        "article_text": "FORCHHEIM, Germany—On the outskirts of this bucolic town, in a region known as “das Medical Valley,” workers on a vast factory floor are assembling what they describe as the future: the game-changing scanners that can give doctors the most detailed images ever of what is happening inside the hearts, lungs and brains of their patients.\nOne of the scanners, two decades in the making and called the “Naeotom Alpha,” is unique, say its inventors at Siemens Healthineers, a global leader in CT technology.“The image quality is incomparable,” boasts Jesús Fernández, head of CT product marketing at the company, comparing the device’s technological leap to the difference between a 1970s television set and HDTV.\nSince the scanners started shipping four years ago, leading hospitals around the world have ordered them. The Food and Drug Administrationcalled the Naeotom Alpha— after approving its use — “the first major new technology for computed tomography imaging in nearly a decade.” Forty percent of the scanners are exported to the U.S. market.\nNow Siemens Healthineers, other medical device makers and their customers are reckoning with a new challenge: the impact of President Donald Trump’s global tariffs.\nThe Trump disruption — the possible winners and losers, and the pure chaos — is roiling global manufacturers, from carmakers to champagne vignerons, as companies scramble to reassess their global trade partners and complex supply chains while trying to divine the president’s next move.\nHigh-end medical devices, including those made by American manufacturers, may be especially vulnerable as many machines are built of components from a dozen vendors around the world. Some scanners cost millions of dollars and are so cutting-edge that hospitals publish a press release when they arrive.\nIn early April, Trump targeted the European Union with a 20 percent levy. Days later, he paused those tariffs for 90 days, leaving a 10 percent across-the-board tax for most European imports, including medical equipment.\nThe pause was set to end at the beginning of July. But on Friday, Trump threatened a 50 percent tariff on all goods from the E.U., beginning June 1, while complaining that trade negotiations with the bloc are “going nowhere.”\nThe medical tech industry — which produces everything from simple syringes to robot surgeons — has pleaded with Trump officials and members of Congress to exempt their products. The tariffs are too broad, recklessly so, critics say, arguing that a medical device is not like an automobile, but a thing vital for human health.\nOpposition to tariffs on medical devices hasn’t come just from Europe, but from the United States, too.\nCompetition in the CT scanner market is already fierce among top manufacturers, which include two American companies, GE and Philips, alongside Toshiba in Japan and Germany-based Siemens.\nScott Whitaker, the CEO ofAdvaMed, a prominent U.S. lobbying association for the sector, warned that Trump’s threat of broad-based tariffs would act as an excise tax. “It will have a negative impact on innovation, cost jobs, and increase overall costs to the health care system,” he said in a statement.\n“Historically, industries with a meaningful humanitarian mission have been exempted from broad tariffs, and as a result we have seen no to low tariffs on med-tech from all key trading partners.”\nThe Trump tariffs on medical equipment will not only cost foreign manufacturers but American companies, too.\nIn anannual reportto shareholders, GE HealthCare warned in April that U.S. tariffs imposed on products from China, along with any future levies on products from Canada, Mexico or other countries, “will likely result in additional costs to us.”\nIt was still too early to say whether the price of the Naeotom Alpha would be impacted. Siemens Healthineers warned earlier this month that tariffs and the “significantly increased volatility of the geopolitical environment will weigh on our business this year.” As a result, the company lowered the midpoint of itsprojected earnings per share.\nOn the call with analysts, Jochen Schmitz, the chief financial officer, said “the biggest impact is imports in the U.S. from Europe.”\nAkin Demehin, vice president of quality and safety policy at the American Hospital Association, said tariffs could disrupt supplies of medical equipment and lead to higher costs.\n“All CT scanners require some maintenance,” he said. “To the extent that those get caught up in overseas supplies and tariffs impact their availability and price, that can potentially impact what the maintenance of those machines looks like,” he said.\nIn Germany, the Siemens Healthineers engineers describe their photon-counting CT scanner as a kind of medical wonder that can produce clearer, faster images for quicker diagnosis in a way that is less invasive for patients. It can help save lives, they say.\nUnlike conventional CT devices that measure the total energy contained in many X-rays at once, the Siemens devices deploy photon-counting detectors that capture each individual X-ray that passes through a patient’s body, which results in more-detailed images.\nThe typical patient can be scanned in just three seconds. The lower radiation compared with conventional CTs means the technology can also be used during pregnancies and on children and babies.\nModern, conventional CT scanners primarily use solid-state crystal detectors made from a variety of materials. But for the photon-counting Naeotom model, Siemens Healthineers relies on cadmium telluride crystals, which the company now produces as well, including at the Forchheim plant.\nThe intricacies of the process are kept tightly under wraps. In one room, identified as “Kristallzüchtung,” or “crystal growing,” fire in a tall black furnace emanates a soft glow. Inside, the synthesis of cadmium and tellurium that creates cadmium telluride is underway.\n“Sometimes it feels a bit like alchemy,” said Paul Heimann, team lead of crystal growth.\nSiemens Healthineers is aiming for all its CTs to be photon-counting devices by 2040. Many in the industry will likely follow its path.\nAbove the testing bays where the humming machines were being readied are star-spangled banners identifying the destination of both conventional and new photon-counting devices.“U.S., U.S., U.S., U.S.,” points out David Engelstätter, head of CT production at the Forchheim plant.\nThe Naeotom Alpha has already been purchased by several U.S. institutions, including the Mayo Clinic, New York University and Duke University, according to Siemens Healthineers. Some of the hospitals releasedjubilant press releaseswhen the scanner was approved for use by the FDA.\nAsked to comment on the possible threat from tariffs, Duke said in a statement: “We are always alert to market changes and are working to ensure we have the necessary equipment and supplies for optimal patient care.” NYU and Mayo declined to comment.\nOverall, the U.S. accounted for more than a quarter of Siemens Healthineers’ business last year.\nMoving production, particularly of the unique photon-counting CTs, is out of the question, said Matthias Kraemer, head of corporate communications for Siemens Healthineers.\nIt did not make business sense to have a lot of small factories churning out small numbers of devices, either in Germany or abroad, he said. “We need that global scale.”\nThe pioneers here in Bavaria say it is the patients who stand to suffer most from trade barriers.\n“We all have family, friends, certainly sick friends or family members,” Engelstätter said on the shop floor. “And then you think, what a shame it would be if I were in the U.S. right now and I were denied this screening — all due to external decisions.”\nIn the United States, hospitals are bracing for the impact of tariffs. Higher costs would have to be absorbed, or passed along to insurers — including the U.S. government — and patients.\nSome 46 percent of hospitals expect that tariffs will increase facility costs in 2025, while an additional 42 percent said they anticipate higher costs when their contracts for supplies are renewed next year, according to a recent Bank of America survey of 50 chief financial officers at hospitals.\nOf the finance chiefs who responded, 91 percent expected costs to go up for medical equipment and devices.\nIn reporting earnings last month, two major American firms that make medical devices — Johnson & Johnson and Abbott Laboratories — both estimated that tariffs would cost them a few hundred million dollars this year. But they also reaffirmed that they still expect to make about the same amount of money for the full year as they previously projected.\nJoaquin Duato, Johnson & Johnson’s CEO, said that if the goal is to incentivize more manufacturing in the U.S. in both medical technology and pharmaceuticals, “the most effective answer is not tariffs, but tax policy.”\nCT scanners range in cost from about $500,000 for entry-level machines to more than $3 million for the highest-end versions. The impact from tariffs could vary widely depending on their individual characteristics, such as where they are manufactured and what countries provide the key components, according to supply-chain experts.\nBut it may take time for hospitals to directly feel the effects of tariffs.\nHospitals may have multiyear contracts for machines, services and repairs, sparing them from immediate impacts, said Josh Hilton, senior director for diagnostic imaging and radiation oncology at Premier, Inc., which contracts with manufacturers to supply hospital customers.\nStill, the uncertainty of tariffs can influence hospital spending. “When things like this happen, the purse strings tend to tighten up a little bit,” Hilton said. Instead of replacing an aging CT scanner this year, a hospital may push back the expenditure to next year, he said.\nJesús Rueda Rodríguez, director general of industrial policy atMedTech Europe, which lobbies for European manufacturers, described complex supply chains. “Components arrive through the United States, China, Europe,” meaning “we can get hit by tariffs not once but multiple times.”\nThe devices are highly regulated by health safety authorities, he said, as are the factories. As a result, “you can’t just pack up and move,” he said.\nLukas Kratz — one of 5,000 employees at the Forchheim site — is a team leader, overseeing the assembly of the photon-counting CTs. Unlike in large-scale automobile factories, much of the work here is still done by hand. Now 29, he began working for Siemens a decade ago after completing his training as an electronics engineer.\n“It’s not just one device we’re working on; we have many variants with many options,” he said. “It’s very difficult to show just anyone how to do this.”\nGilbert reported from Washington and Booth from London."

        "article_text": "Russia’s battlefield strength in Ukraine has started to wane and it could run into serious shortages of manpower and weaponry by next year, even as President Donald Trump retreats from pressure on Moscow to end the war, according to senior U.S. and European officials and military experts.\nIn recent days, Trump appears to have abandoned the threat of harsh financial sanctions he repeated as recently as two weeks ago if Moscow doesn’t agree to a ceasefire with Kyiv. Instead, after a two-hour phone call Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he touted potential new trade deals with Russia.\nRather than the U.S. leadership he promised, Trump has mused that he might just walk away and leave the negotiations to the Europeans — perhaps even the new pope — to sort out. His administration has not committed to additional military or financial aid to Ukraine.\nBut the timing for putting pressure on Moscow may be more advantageous now than at any point since the early days of the conflict, according to more than a dozen officials who discussed the current state of the war and the sensitive politics and diplomacy surrounding it, most on the condition of anonymity.\nAbsent a negotiated settlement or “robust” Western assistance, the war “probably will continue to slowly trend in Russia’s favor through 2025,” according to a U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessment presented to Congress 10 days ago by DIA Director Lt. Gen Jeffrey Krause. But Russian gains “are slowing and continue to come at the expense of high personnel and equipment losses.”\nSince its February 2022 invasion, the DIA assessment said, Russia has “lost at least 10,000 ground combat vehicles, including more than 3,000 tanks, as well as nearly 250 aircraft and helicopters and more than 10 naval vessels.”\nOver the past year, Russia has taken only 0.6 percent of additional Ukrainian territory, at the cost of 1,500 killed or wounded per day, current and former Western officials said. “Russia is very gradually taking bits of territory still, but at an unsustainably high cost,” said Richard Barrons, the former head of Britain’s Joint Forces Command. Some officials have estimated Russia’s total casualties at more than a million.\nIn the meantime, Europe is struggling to find a way to increase supplies to Ukraine, and Kyiv has its own problems with both personnel and equipment despite steadily growing domestic arms output. Neither side has been able to advance significantly on the ground, and the war has evolved into an exchange of long-range fire with missiles and increasingly sophisticated drones.\nRussia has pummeled Kyiv and other regions, launching 250 attack drones and 14 ballistic missiles overnight Friday, according to a statement by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russian officials claimed more than 700 Ukrainian drones were intercepted over Russian territory within the past 72 hours, nearly 100 of them near Moscow.\nBut drones and long-range strikes do not conquer territory and will not win the war for either side, officials and experts said.\n“With every such strike, the world sees more clearly that it is Moscow that’s prolonging this war,” Zelensky said. “It’s clear now that much more pressure must be applied to Russia for any real diplomacy to begin. … Only additional sanctions targeting key sectors of the Russian economy will force Moscow to stop the attacks.”\nIn public comments after his call with Putin, Trumpdid not mention either sanctions on Russia or aid to Ukraine. Speaking with European leaders, he indicated that the Russian leader did not seem inclined to halt a war he believes is going in his favor, a person familiar with the exchanges said.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, in Senate testimony Tuesday, defended Trump’s lack of action. Kyiv, he said, was “still getting armaments and shipments from us and our allies” — although the administration has not sought any new funding or drawdowns from U.S. stockpiles. “The European Union is about to impose additional sanctions,” Rubio said, while the United States was “looking for more” scarce Patriot air defense batteries from NATO allies to transfer to Ukraine.\nRubio denied one senator’s suggestion that Putin was “playing” Trump and said that all Biden-era sanctions against Russia were still in place. But “the president’s belief is … right now, [if] you start threatening sanctions, the Russians will stop talking. And there’s value in us being able to talk to them and drive them to get to the table.”\nSo far, Putin has ignored Trump’s call for a 30-day ceasefire and sent a low-level delegation to a negotiating session in Istanbul to which Trump had dispatched Rubio.\nOn Wednesday, Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) introduced legislation, co-sponsored by 81 other senators, questioning the value of those talks and threatening to impose primary and secondary sanctions on Russia if it refuses to engage in good-faith negotiations with Ukraine. Graham, a stalwart Trump supporter, has been in constant and consistent conversation with the White House on the issue, a person familiar with the senator’s views said.\nAmong other things, the legislation would impose a 500 percent U.S. tariff on goods imported from countries, including China, that purchase Russian oil, gas, uranium and other products. In a statement, Graham noted that Rubio had said Moscow agreed in the Istanbul talks to provide its terms for a ceasefire in the next few days. “If it is more of the same,” Graham said, “Russia can expect decisive action from the United States Senate.”\nMoscow’s negotiating terms, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday, would be based on the “root causes” of the conflict, a reference to Moscow’s repeated insistence that Ukraine is historically a part of Russia that has become a corrupt, illegitimate and Nazi-ruled state. A true peace agreement, Lavrov said, could be negotiated and signed only by a “legitimate,” newly elected Ukrainian government.\n“Putin believes that time is on his side, and Ukraine is bleeding faster than Russia,” said a senior European official. Amid growing concerns over how long Ukraine can hold out, proponents of increased pressure on Moscow have tried to focus attention on Russia’s growing weaknesses.\nThe Kremlin has drawn a record number of recruits this year, although many have been enticed with cash payouts and the expectation the war will soon end. But the rate of Russia’s advance on the ground has been slowed to a near-standstill, in part because of Ukraine’s fortification of a 10-mile defensive zone littered with mines and trenches and the use of short-range drones to attack any Russian approach to the front lines, according to Jack Watling, a senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London.\nA Ukrainian security official said the stalled advance may also be partially due to Russia being forced to divert resources to reclaim the sliver of its land in the Kursk region along Ukraine’s northeastern border.\n“Russia is not able to take any ground, and this is the situation pretty much since the end of the Ukrainian counteroffensive” in 2023, the Ukrainian official said. “Despite the fact that they still have three-to-one superiority in number of troops — and maybe even bigger in terms of [weapons]systems — it’s still not enough.”\nWhile capable of producing at least 200 new tanks a year, Russia has depended heavily on therefurbishment of mothballed Soviet-era ones, an estimated 13,000-tank stockpile at the beginning of the war that Western experts calculate is likely to run out in the next few months.\n“The Russians can continue fighting, but … the force will become more and more de-mechanized over time, and that does put a timeline on how long they can sustain the current way they operate,” Watling said.\nIf no ceasefire is arranged, Russia is likely to use its narrowing window of superiority to intensify attacks over the summer in a bid to break through Ukraine’s exhausted ranks, Watling and Barrons said. But it could be Moscow’s last opportunity.\n“Russia is actually culminating in its ability to conduct an offensive,” Barrons said. “It is very unlikely now that the Russian military have the equipment, the people, and the training and logistics to mount an offensive that would break the Ukrainian line and — even if they did — to exploit it immediately.”\nEven if Russia succeeded in gaining more Ukrainian territory, the Kremlin is unlikely to achieve its stated goal of seizing full control of the four regions it illegally annexed in the fall of 2022 — Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia — according to Dara Massicot, senior research fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n“There’s a difference between pushing the Ukrainians back five to 10 kilometers at a time at high cost versus having the assembled manpower and armor behind that to exploit a breakthrough and to occupy and push through all of those obstacles, even though the Ukrainians are having issues,” Massicot said. “That’s still a really large bill in terms of equipment that they need, and I just don’t see that concentration anywhere.”\nWhen Putin visited the Kursk region Wednesday for the first time since it was retaken from Ukraine, a local official suggested to him that the Russian army should now occupy the bordering Ukrainian region of Sumy.\nPutin joked in response that the Kursk governor “always wants everything bigger.” But as he seeks to drag out negotiations and fend off Trump’s blandishments, Western officials said that Putin’s confidence may be based more on rosy assessments from his subordinates than on reality. “I think they overestimate the current success of Russia,” a senior European official said.\nWhether Putin genuinely believes he has “all the cards,” as Trump has put it, or is simply waiting for the West to grow tired of the seemingly unending conflict, dwindling stockpiles of Soviet-era equipment will make Russia increasingly dependent on new systems produced from scratch. That, a number of Western officials and experts said, makes it the right time to impose new sanctions and to continue to supply new weaponry to Ukraine.\n“If Ukraine can deny Russia from reaching the borders of Donetsk between now and Christmas, and Kyiv’s international partners are diligent in degrading Russia’s economy, Moscow will face hard choices about the costs it is prepared to incur for continuing the war,” Watling said.\nBelton reported from London. Ellen Francis in Brussels and Mariana Alfaro in Washington contributed to this report."

        "article_text": "Some Republican-led states are moving to require voters to prove their citizenship, as Texas advances a controversial measure that could make it harder for eligible voters to get on the rolls because of changed names, mislaid paperwork or database errors.\nVoting rights advocates and Democrats warn the plans could prove particularly tricky for people who change their names, including women who do so when they get married or divorced, because their legal names don’t match the ones on their birth certificates. Supporters call the criticism overblown, saying most Americans can readily show they are citizens.\nThe emerging laws are part of a GOP push led by President Donald Trump to tighten requirements to cast ballots. Voting by noncitizens is both illegal and rare, and the attempts to crack down on voting by foreigners could drive down participation from a much larger pool of legitimate voters, according to election experts.\nThe Texas legislation passed the state Senate last month, and Republican proponents are hoping to advance the bill through the House by next week as the legislative session wraps up. As two dozen other states consider similar measures, Texas Republicans are weighing whether to change their proposalto more smoothly accommodate name changes, according to people tracking the legislation. The political fight in the state illuminates a larger debate across the country over how to balance election security and access to the ballot.\nAbout 500,000 of the 18.6 million voters already on the rolls in Texas would need to provide proof of citizenship under the proposal therebecause they don’t have driver’s license numbers or Social Security numbers on file with election officials. Similarly, it would require new voters to prove their citizenship with a passport, birth certificate or naturalization papers.\nNot everyone has access to citizenship documents, and the measure does notspecify how officials should handle records that don’t match because of name changes. Some other states with similar laws require those who change their names to submit marriage certificates or divorce decrees, which voting rights advocates say amounts to an additional barrier to casting ballots.\n“The likely outcome of this bill [in Texas] is that in pursuit of keeping a very small number of noncitizens from being able to vote, they’re almost certainly going to exclude a much larger number of eligible citizens from voting,” said Daniel Griffith, a senior policy director with Secure Democracy USA, a nonpartisan group focused on building confidence in election systems.\nTrump and other Republicans have repeatedly made false claims that large numbers of immigrants are illegally voting. The presidentsigned an executive orderin March aimed at requiring citizenship documents to register to vote, but a judgeblocked his directivelast month. Four states require voters to provide proof of citizenship, and others are rushing to join them. Opponents are preparing court challenges.\nDemocratssay they are bracing for changes that could hit low-income and minority voters hard and diminish turnout among those who tend to align with their party. But a recent survey that found more Texas Republicans than Texas Democrats lack easy access to citizenship documents has led to some debate about how the proposal would affect each party.\nThe Texas legislation would apply to local, state and presidential elections. Proof of citizenship would not be required to vote in U.S. House and Senate races because of a 2013 Supreme Court decision.\nState Rep. Carrie Isaac (R), a sponsor of the measure, saidshe thinksit would prevent noncitizens from getting on the voter rolls without tripping up lawful voters because most of them have the documents they need or can obtain them.\n“I don’t think we should have any concerns,” Isaac said. “I believe that everyone pretty much is not going to feel this legislation.”\nBut Austin voter Carrie King, a Democrat, was so alarmed by the legislation that she spent a day at the state Capitol last month to testify against it. Texas had the second-lowest voting participation rate in the country last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and King worries the bill will drive it down further.\n“I think that people who might have considered taking more steps towards getting registered or towards voting are going to get chilled out and frozen out and are going to be intimidated and are going to not vote,” she said in an interview.\nChristina Adkins, the elections director for Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson (R), told lawmakers in a hearing last month that nothing in the legislation requires names on birth certificates and other documents to match voters’ names. “If your birth certificate has a name that’s different than your voter registration record,” she said, “under this bill, that’s okay.”\nBut the legislation does not specify what happens when such mismatches occur, and election officials across Texas’s 254 counties would get to decide what documents to accept. While voting rights advocates called Adkins’s comments reassuring,they said they worry that election officials would reject some voters’ paperwork because of name differences. And they noted that the secretary of state’s office has not issued any formal guidance to election officials, and a future secretary of state could restrict what documents to accept. Adkins declined an interview request through an aide.\nVeronikah Warms, a voting rights policy attorney for the nonpartisan Texas Civil Rights Project, said she believes the 8 in 10 women who change their names when they get married would need a passport, which many do nothave, to register to vote.\n“It’s about $130 to apply for a passport for the first time,” Warms said. “And even more if you need to expedite it.”\nDallas voter Isabella Russell-Ides, a Democrat, recalledrecently filling out paperwork to try to fast-track her airport security clearance application. Her passport had expired, so she presented her birth certificate, a divorce decree, her marriage license, court records and her old passport. “You have to prove who you are,” she said. “And they wouldn’t give it to me.”\nRussell-Ides, 77, changed her last name twice during two marriages, and later in life changed her first name. She said she will probably spend time and money to reconcile her unmatched records. “But it’s going to be a royal pain in the ass,” she said.\nSandra Maria Garcia Rubio came to Fort Worth from a village in Durango, Mexico, with a name that paid tribute to her ancestors. She changed it three decades ago because she was told 22 letters wouldn’t fit on naturalization forms. She shortened it again for her Social Security card and now goes by Sandra Garcia.\nGarcia is already registered to vote and has a passport with her current name on it. But she is worried that her mismatched documents could lead someone to challenge her ability to cast a ballot. Other naturalized citizens share similar concerns because some government databases haven’t been updated to reflect that they’ve obtained citizenship.\n“None of my stuff matches,” said Garcia, 54, a Democrat. “Am I even going to be able to vote?”\nJill Tate, vice president of legislation for the Texas Federation of Republican Women, said the measure will ensure “secure, honest elections.” It won’t place an undue burden on women, who are used to gathering and updating documents for major life events, she said.\n“Women have been doing it for decades — they’re smart,” said Tate. “I don’t think we’re asking for too much here.”\nMelissa, a Trump voter from the Dallas-Fort Worth area who spoke on the condition that only her first name be used for privacy reasons, said she supports ensuring voters are American citizens — even if it is an inconvenience for her. Her married name doesn’t match the name on her birth certificate, but her current name is on her passport, she said.\n“If we’re making policies for our country, then we need to be sure it’s our people who are voting,” she said.\nSix years ago, Texas election officials claimed nearly 100,000 voters were possibly noncitizens, but a federal judge quicklystopped their effortsto remove them from the rolls after finding their efforts were “ham-handed” and “threatening.”\nCourts, election officials and independent reviews have found few instances of voting by noncitizens. For instance, a federal judge in 2018 determined at most 39 noncitizens were placed on the voter rolls in Kansas over 19 years, with most of them winding up there because of likely administrative errors.\nIn Texas, election officials last year canceled the voter registrations of 63 noncitizens and 124 people who did not respond to inquiries about their citizenship status, according toa reportfrom the secretary of state’s office.\nAbout 1.3 million Texans would have difficulty proving their citizenship, according toa University of Maryland surveylast year. About 1 percent of Texas Republicans lack proof of citizenship and 7 percent cannot easily get copies of such proof. Nearly all Texas Democrats have such documentation but about 4 percent would have trouble obtaining it, according to the survey.\nTom Bonier, a senior adviser with the Democratic data firm TargetSmart, said the Texas measure could make it harder to register rural voters, less frequent voters and married women, whom Republicans often count on for support.\n“That’s one case where potentially the Republicans are making a tactical error, perhaps not thinking through the ramifications,” he said.\nBut Republican pollster Whit Ayres was skeptical. “Most MAGA voters are going to have already registered or have whatever it takes to register,” he said, using an acronym for Trump’s Make America Great Again movement.\nState Rep. John Bucy III, a Democrat from Austin and vice chairman of the Texas House’s elections committee, said he’s trying to negotiate with Republicans to change the bill to make it easier for women who change their names to register to vote. But even with adjustments, he sees trouble ahead.\n“If they pass any form of this bill, it’s just going to be voter suppression at its finest here in the state of Texas,” he said.\nSome form of proof-of-citizenship legislation has been introduced in half the states this year, according to the nonpartisan Voting Rights Lab.\nArizona for more than a decade has required voters to prove they are citizens, and three other states — Louisiana, New Hampshire and Wyoming — recently adopted similar laws. Lawsuits are pending in the states with new laws, and Arizonarecently discoveredit had wrongly kept about 200,000 people on the voter rolls even though officials had no record that they had provided proof of citizenship.\nIf the legislation in Texas becomes law, litigation is almost certain. “We’re going to sue. We’re going to sue. We’re going to sue,” said Juan Proaño, the CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens. Courts have considered citizenship requirements for more than a decade, and thenew laws will test the boundaries of rulings that have so far curbed how far states can go.\nThe Texas measure would take effect in September if it is enacted, and election officials would be required to determine the citizenship status of voters already on the rolls by the end of the year. That effort could create disruptions for voters and election administrators just before the March 2026 primaries. Election officials who wrongly register noncitizens could be charged with crimes, according to the legislation.\nJessica White, the elections administrator in Parmer County in the Texas panhandle, said she is waiting to see what lawmakers pass to determine how extensive a review she will need to do in her sparsely populated area. She has no staff but said she could recruit people to help if needed.\n“There’s no reason for me to be stressing over it when it may not even come to pass,” she said.\nRemi Garza, the elections administrator in Cameron County along the Mexican border, is preparing for a logistical disaster during this fall’s local elections. He hopes lawmakers change the legislation to give front-line election officials more time to prepare to implement it.\n“If it is something that goes directly into effect just before the November local elections,” he said, “it is creating an opportunity for chaos.”"

        "article_text": "KYIV — Russia launched another massive missile and drone attack across Ukraine early Sunday, killing 12 people, including at least three children — casting further doubt on Moscow’s intentions in an already shaky peace process brokered by President Donald Trump.\nThe attack, which lasted several hours and followed another large attack the night before, came even as Russia and Ukraine proceeded with adays-long prisoner exchangethe two sides agreed to during a rare summit in Istanbul last week.\nUkrainian officials  urged Western countries, including the United States, to apply new sanctions on Russia to prevent it from building more weapons used to target Ukrainian civilians.\n“The world may go into weekend mode, but the war does not stop for weekends or weekdays. This cannot be ignored,” President Volodymyr Zelenskywroteon Telegram. “Silence of America and others around the world only emboldens Putin.”\nThe Russian assault involved nearly 400 missiles and drones, including nine ballistic missiles that Ukrainian air defenses, already strained and in short supply, failed to intercept, Ukraine’s air forcesaid. Zelensky described the strikes as “deliberate” and said they hit civilian residential buildings, university dormitories and industrial sites.\nRussia’s Defense MinistrysaidSunday that it launched a “massive” overnight strike targeting military production facilities, adding: “The strike objectives have been achieved.”\nSome of the missiles used were North Korean, and the  attack drones were almost entirely Iranian-designedShaheds, the air force said.\nThe use of such weapons to attack civilians lays bare how Russia has expanded its war on Ukraine by relying on weapons supplied by countries hostile to the West, including North Korea and Iran. Ukraine’s partners, meanwhile, have not yet made guarantees to continue providing urgently needed air defenses that could help defend against such attacks, including U.S.-made Patriot systems.\nDespite receiving some systems from Western partners, Ukraine has never had nearly enough supplies to defend the entire country, forcing it to regularly move its limited systems between cities in an attempt to predict the next attacks. As a result, each night, most of the population is left vulnerable to Russian attacks.\nUkraine  agreed to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire proposed by the United States, but Russia has thus far refused the plan.\nTrump urged the two sides to meet face-to-face in Istanbul earlier this month and Zelensky said he was even prepared to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Moscow insteadsent a low-level delegationand the talks failed to produce a ceasefire; the only concrete result from the talks was the agreement that each side would release 1,000 prisoners, a swap that has unfolded over the last several days.\nAfter Putin refused to travel to Turkey, Trump claimed that the only way to achieve progress in the war would be by him speaking directly to the Russian leader. The two menspoke for several hoursby phone last week and Russia has since ramped up its devastating attacks across Ukraine.\n“Russia is slowing down all the processes related to the end of the war in order to kill. We have long been ready to cease fire, but Russia is doing everything to continue destroying people, because Putin likes it,” wrote Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine’s presidential office, onTelegram.\n“Without pressure, nothing will change and Russia and its allies will only build up forces for such murders in Western countries. Moscow will fight as long as it has the ability to produce weapons.”\nIn Kyiv, the buzz of Russian drones, steady drum of machine gunfire and blasts of air defense systems could be heard in the capital throughout the night. By morning, the scale of destruction had emerged. An entire street in the capital appeared to have been largely destroyed.\nIn the neighboring Zhytomyr region, rescuers dug through rubble searching for the remains of three children, aged 8, 12 and 17. Ukrainian officials said the children were all from the same family and that the parents were severely wounded in the attack.\nDamage was reported throughout the country, including in the west. “Civilian homes were the target,” Ukraine’s state emergency services said, noting that more than 80 residential buildings were damaged, and at least 70 people were wounded.\n“When the entire world calls for an end to the killing, Putin orders even more strikes, attacks and murders of children,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybihawrote on X."

        "article_text": "TEHRAN — For many in Iran’s capital city, years of sanctions, mismanagement and corruption have meant learning to make do with less and putting dreams on hold.\nIn the past year alone, the Iranian rial has lost half its value. Companies, cut off from international banking systems by Western sanctions, struggle to raise capital or attract customers. Inflation is so high, many report that grocery store prices seem to change almost daily.\nWashington Post interviews with people across Tehran offered a rare window into the lives and economic struggles of the country’s urban middle class — mired in a status quo that feels stagnant but stable, at least for now.\nAgainst this backdrop, Iranian leaders entered into complex and delicatenegotiations with the United Stateslast month, seeking sanctions relief in exchange for limits on the country’s nuclear program. A fifth round of talks in Rome on Friday made “some but not conclusive progress,” according to the mediator, Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi. The two sides remain at an impasse over the central issue, with U.S. officials suggesting they will push for zero enrichment of nuclear material and Iran insisting such a position would render a deal impossible.\nSome have interpreted the Iranian government’sdecision to engageas a reflection of weakness. Officials, analysts and ordinary citizens in Iran paint a more nuanced picture — of a country hungry for change but far from the breaking point.\n“It is difficult, but we have found a way to manage,” said Mariam, 37, sitting with her childhood friend Sarah in a manicured park in central Tehran while their children played nearby. Both women said they were generally supportive of the system in Iran, even if “some politicians only care about filling their pockets,” Sarah quipped.\nLike others in this story, they spoke on the condition that they be identified by their first names for fear of repercussions from authorities.\nBoth women are middle class. They own the homes they live in and were able to stop working when they had children, supported by their husbands’ wages. They said they’ve adjusted to inflation and other economic pressures with frugality: The kids get fewer toys and less new clothing, and family vacations are rare.\nAlthough Mariam is comfortable with the new normal, she said there’s “no way” the country can endure sanctions indefinitely.\n“This younger generation is different from our generation,” she said with a slight smile. “My husband worked as a teenager. But we tell our own children to study, not to work; they’re less resilient than us.” When her son was out of earshot, she lovingly complained to her friend that he was gaining weight from eating too much ice cream.\nEsfandyar Batmanghelidj, the chief executive of the Bourse & Bazaar Foundation, a London-based think tank that tracks Iran’s economy, said household income data has shown structural adjustment — even improvement — since last year.\n“There has been this kind of adaptation to the new reality,” he said, referring to the sanctions reimposed in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term, followed soon after by the coronavirus pandemic. “It seems like the country is coming out of the darkest period of its economic situation.”\nAlthough Iran still has “profound” challenges related to inefficiencies and mismanagement — illustrated most recently by widespread power outages — the data does not suggest a country “on the precipice of economic collapse,” Batmanghelidj said.\nSince returning to office, Trump has tightened sanctions on Iran, largely targeting individuals and entities involved in exporting oil to China. But the rial has rebounded slightly since the resumption of talks with the United States.\nEven if Iran isn’t experiencing a runaway economic crisis, its leaders still have significant incentives to pursue sanctions relief, according to Batmanghelidj. Looking across the Persian Gulf at the glittering cities of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, “they are getting the sense that they’re being left behind.”\nIranian officials have repeatedly made the argument that Washington’s maximum pressure campaign has failed to break the country.\n“They have accepted that Iran is powerful in certain areas, and for this reason, they have sat down at the negotiating table with us,” former Iranian atomic agency chief Fereydoon Abbasi said in aninterviewwith an Iranian news outlet. “If we were a weak country, they would definitely attack us.”\nInside Iran, even those who support the talks speak about them with a jaded weariness, a contrast with the buoyant national mood in the lead-up to the first nuclear deal negotiated with the Obama administration. When the accord was signed in 2015, people in Tehran danced in the streets.\nSome attribute the lack of excitement this time to a general disillusionment with the Iranian regime, which hardened for many after security forces violently put downnationwide protests in 2023. Others have a dim view of Trump, who withdrew from the Obama-era nuclear deal and in 2020 ordered thekilling of Qasem Soleimani, then the country’s most celebrated military commander.\n“After Trump killed Soleimani, of course there is no trust,” said a woman shopping on the edge of a northern Tehran bazaar. “Our martyrs, they are very important to us,” she said, pausing as she searched for words. “We really love them.”\nAcross Tehran, there are portraits commemorating fallen political and military leaders. Soleimani’s face is still among the most prominent, adorning government buildings, residential apartment blocks and highway overpasses.\nLike other supporters of the regime, the woman said she supports talks with the United States but isn’t getting her hopes up. “Let’s see what happens,” she said, shrugging.\nMany Iranians are less forgiving of their country’s leadership, even in the relative bubble of Tehran, which receives more resources than other parts of the country. At an upscale mall lined with gold shops, boutiques of imported clothing and knockoff designer shoes, 44-year-old Nirvana said the poor economy had forced her to rethink her future.\n“I used to want to get married, but now I see my friends and how hard it is for them,” she said. Monthly rents in Tehran have skyrocketed, and people’s salaries aren’t keeping up. “It’s better to stay at home with your parents.”\nAt a nearby shop owned by Sahriar, 46, and his wife, Bahar, 43, the couple said they decided not to have children, citing the lack of economic opportunity. “Children don’t have a future here,” Sahriar said.\nIf things don’t change soon, he said, it’s probably just a matter of months before he’ll no longer be able to make rent on his store. Though the city’s shopping malls look busy, most people just come to walk, he said; very few buy anything.\nThe lack of purchasing power was also apparent in the carpet section of Tehran’s grand bazaar. Shops were stocked with inventory from floor to ceiling, but customers were hard to find.\n“My wife is a teacher. It used to be that on a teacher’s salary, you could save to buy a nice carpet, but now no one can save,” said Mustafa, 41, who works in the bazaar as a kind of personal shopper, guiding potential buyers to the right shops.\n“All our money goes to the essentials, nothing extra,” he said.\nMustafa wonders if Iran’s leaders are unaware of the situation for people like him, or if they’re just indifferent. He’s become so frustrated, he said, that he hopes the nuclear talks will fail and hasten the fall of the regime.\n“I hope the government is overthrown,” said Mustafa, acknowledging that such a scenario would probably be chaotic and dangerous. “Everything has a price. I’m ready to be destroyed if it means that future generations will be happy,” he said."

        "article_text": "WEST POINT, N.Y. — When President Donald Trump last addressed the graduating class of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, protests inspired by the police killing of George Floyd had swept the country — forcing a reckoning on college campuses that extended to the storied institution.\nThen, school officials directed cadets to spend an academic year exploring how to “unearth and confront racism, sexism, and other biases that persist at this academy and that undermine American society.”\nNow, five years later, the academy has banished talk of systemic inequity, abolished student affinity clubs for women and minorities, and instructed faculty to purge terms such as “feminist” and “systemic racism” from syllabi, all at the order of their commander in chief.\nReturning to address graduates on Saturday, he arrived at a different West Point: one his administration has swiftly reshaped to reflect his worldview.\n“You are the first West Point graduates of the golden age of America,” Trump said, adding later, “We’ve turned it around.”\nTrump, who gave the speech wearing a hat emblazoned with his campaign slogan “Make America Great Again,” intertwined his political ideology with words about the military’s success. He said that as president, he had rebuilt the military “better than ever before” and rid it of “social experiments” like the teaching of critical race theory and efforts to support transgender soldiers. And he took credit for a rise in military recruitment.\nTrump also made a point to criticize his predecessor, Joe Biden, and what he cast as liberal ideas, claiming that politicians “subjected the armed forces to all manner of social projects” and declaring, “We will not have men playing women’s sports.”\n“It’s a feeling of real whiplash,” said Graham Parsons, a former West Point professor who resigned from America’s oldest service academy after publicly criticizing the impact of Trump’s policies. “We used to raise the possibility that in the military and beyond, there are still real structural problems with racism and sexism. That would not fly now.”\nSince reclaiming the White House, Trump has set his sights on institutions of higher education as keys to unraveling the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that he says have corrupted American culture. In some instances, he has experienced challenges from the courts or universities as they dispute the limits of his power. But at West Point, an institution run by the Pentagon, the president can, for the most part, have his way.\nSeveral professors and military observers said the changes implemented at the academy in response to Trump’s executive orders have thrust the historically nonpartisan institution into the partisan fray.\n“Critics are saying that the administration does not seem to understand that and is making reckless changes to the ways we develop military leaders,” said Peter Feaver, a professor at Duke University and an expert on civil-military relations.\nIn a statement, the White House said Trump’s predecessor had politicized the armed services.\n“After Joe Biden spent four years injecting DEI, gender ideology, and woke politics into military policy, President Trump is restoring a military that is solely based on excellence, readiness, and lethality,” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said in a statement. “On the battlefield, there can be no accommodation for anything less than resilience, strength, and the ability to withstand extraordinary physical demands.”\nLess than six months into his second term, Trump has already made his mark on the military.\nIn January, he endured a bruising political fight over his pick for defense secretary, former “Fox & Friends Weekend” co-host Pete Hegseth, batting down allegations of misconduct to elevate a leader who shared his view that a focus on diversity, equity and inclusion had weakened the military.\nSince then, Trump and Hegseth have fired at least nine senior military officers who regularly touted diversity training as a strength during the Biden administration. They have declared that DEI policies “are incompatible with the values” of the Defense Department and prohibited academies from teaching what they have called “critical race theory,” which Republicans made a flash point during the presidential campaign.\nHegseth has said the policy changes are aimed at increasing the lethality of the nation’s fighting forces, even as the administration has stated its intention to limit the nation’s participation in armed conflict.\nIn signing the executive order, Trump said he was “committed to meritocracy and to the elimination of race-based and sex-based discrimination” in the U.S. Armed Forces.\nThis holiday weekend, Trump’s schedule will be bookended by military-centric events. On Monday, he is scheduled to attend a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery.\nVice President JD Vance, who is also expected to attend the Arlington ceremony on Monday, gave his own address to military graduates on Friday, telling U.S. Naval Academy midshipmen that the administration’s change in approach to deploying military force meant the United States “ought to be cautious in deciding to throw a punch.” He did not spend time discussing the academic standards at the institution.\nAnd on June 14, the White House has planned amultimillion-dollarmilitary paradeon the National Mall to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army — a date that coincides with the president’s birthday.\nAcross military academies, some students and faculty have subtly resisted the Trump administration’s decrees, hoping to maintain an academic culture that tolerates disparate political views and fosters racial diversity.\nAt the U.S. Naval Academy, some midshipmen have started using nongovernment email addresses to run underground versions of the same affinity clubs disbanded by their administration. Others have used the new email addresses to communicate their concerns about banned books or shuttered clubs to professors, according to three faculty members interviewed by The Washington Post. The faculty spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional retribution. Military officers who use “contemptuous words” against the president and other federal officials can be court-martialed,according to themilitary code of conduct.\nAt West Point, some faculty have tweaked language in their syllabi to comply while continuing to teach the same topics, said Parsons.\nParsons, who taught philosophy and military ethics at the academy, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece that Trump had so changed West Point that Parsons was “ashamed to be associated with the academy.”\n“Once a school that strove to give cadets the broad-based, critical-minded, nonpartisan education they need for careers as Army officers, [West Point] was suddenly eliminating courses, modifying syllabuses and censoring arguments to comport with the ideological tastes of the Trump administration.”\nAfter it published, the school launched an investigation into “allegations of misconduct,” he said. Parsons said he resigned before he was fired.\nHis last day was Friday, a day before Trump was set to address his former students.\nSpokespeople for the U.S. Military Academy and the U.S. Naval Academy did not return requests for comment Friday.\nA Naval Academy professor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said he has told his students “there is a point where compliance turns into complicity.”\nThatprofessor said he has already seen academic consequences related to Trump’s rhetoric and directives.\nStudents once felt free to debate affirmative action, abortion and gun control. They argued about whether the country should lean more interventionist or more isolationist, the professor said.\nThen Trump issued the executive order, which was soon followed by Hegseth’s memo that abolished “DEI offices and any vestiges of such offices,” banned instruction on race or gender, and told professors to teach that “America and its founding documents remain the most powerful force for good in human history.”\nFaculty havesince been told to run their research through an AI screening tool to determine whether they are compliant with the new guidelines, documents show. The device then flags words including “barrier,” “Black,” “allyship,” “cultural differences” and the “Gulf of Mexico” that do not comply with Trump’s executive order, the provost told faculty in a newsletter reviewed by The Post.\n“We at the Naval Academy are here to prepare young officers to command. They need to know what we have learned from our study of politics and history and literature and languages,” the professor said. “We are failing them and we are failing in our jobs if we suppress some things we know are true and we parrot other things we know are false.”\nThe tension has come up in class and in individual exchanges with cadets. The professor said he has counseled students who feel torn about deployment, caught between their belief in service to the country and their worries about the president who would give their orders.\nHe advised them to serve until they face an order they believe to be illegal.\nIf that point comes, he told them, “reject it rather than compromise yourself.”\nNatalie Allison contributed to this report."

        "article_text": "ORLANDO —\nShigeru Miyamoto wanted to share what he calls “a little bit of a strange story” as he sat in a lavish and hushed lounge tucked in the middle of Universal Orlando, where the third Super Nintendo World theme park opened Thursday.\nNow 72, the most influential creator in the video games art form has come a long way from his youth as an industrial design student at the Kanazawa College of Art, a tiny public school. He was a lifetime and a world away in Florida to open another theme park he helped design, but for a moment, his memory traveled back to his college days to rediscover the first time he built a world to enter and play.\n“I thought I would create a toy that helps kids learn how to count,” Miyamoto told The Washington Post through an interpreter. “There’s all these pieces laid out on the table, with things like poles or cubes you would drop in. But in addition to that, what I did was then take that toy set and expand it so that you can actually walk into it. That was all part of my graduation project.\n“Fast forward to now, looking at the 8-bit game and seeing this world that we’ve been able to branch out, I really see a little bit of synchronicity in that experience. I find myself thinking that I’m doing the same thing. … I really feel like my interests are still fundamentally the same.”\nMiyamoto created the original Mario, Donkey Kong and Legend of Zelda games, the foundations of the 135-year-old Nintendo’s rebirth as a video game company. Nintendo and “Super Mario Bros.” are often cited for rejuvenating the industry after the video game crash of 1983, when the nascent industry imploded after a flood of poor quality products. His attention to quality control and play formed the nucleus of countless video game genres and lifted the industry out of recession and into one of the planet’s dominant entertainment mediums.\nHis imprint on the medium is immeasurable. In 1998, he was the first person inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame. In France, he washonored as a Knight of Arts and Letters. In Spain, he isthe first video game creator honored with the Princess of Asturias Award. In 2019, he was the first game creator to receive Japan’s Person of Cultural Merit award.\nNow he is one of the few people to have theme parks built from his creations. Just as one could walk around the Jurassic Park world of Orlando and hear John Williams’s iconic score, Super Nintendo World echoes with theindelible jazz pieces of Koji Kondo’s Mario themes. Even the bathrooms play the water-level waltz of the classic games.\n“I don’t think in a million years when he was sketching out Donkey Kong and Mario … that he would’ve ever imagined they would be a centerpiece of a major international theme park,” said Roger DiLuigi, a 35-year-old content creator from Los Angeles with more than 550,000 subscribers on his Nintendo-focusedRogersBase YouTube channel. The lifelong Nintendo fan was among hundreds of influencers and creators invited to cover and promote the Orlando Epic Universe launch. “And yet here we are.”\nToday as an executive and representative director, Miyamoto’s fingerprints are most evident inNintendo’s expansion to other mediums, including the Super Nintendo World theme parks, the billion dollar box office blockbuster Mario movie released in 2023 and the recently opened Nintendo Museum in Kyoto.\nNintendo’s origins in the U.S. began with a lawsuit by Universal City Studios. In 1982, the media conglomerate sued Nintendo over Miyamoto’s first hit game “Donkey Kong,” claiming infringement on the King Kong property. Nintendo hired veteran Washington, D.C.-based civil rights attorney John Kirby and won the case. Nintendo would honor Kirby,who died in 2019, by naming a character after him as thanks for helping the company regain foothold in the U.S. market.\nNintendo and Universal Studios announced their plans to partner in creating theme parks in 2015, with the first park opening in Japan in 2021. Universal’s Epic Universe in Orlando, including Super Nintendo World featuring the Mario brand, is the first in the U.S. to include an expansion forDonkey Kong Country.\n“The world really does work in mysterious ways,” Miyamoto exclaimed, laughing. “It was really fun to be able to jokingly talk about what if we put Donkey Kong on the other side of King Kong in City Walk!”\nNintendo’s decision to fight the lawsuit was seen as a sign that the company, and video games as a medium, had arrived. Miyamoto keenly remembers when people would look down their noses at video games.\n“When I first created Mario, it was a time where Mom or Dad might look at their kids playing a video game and be worried, concerned about what’s going to happen,” he said. “I was expecting there will come a time when even the parent will have experience playing video games. That was something I was hoping to see. Now I’m over 70 years old, and we’re finally at a time where multigenerational families all have this common shared experience of having played video games. It’s really great to see that come to realization.”\nHis dream is fully realized. Millennial parents teaching their children the history of characters like Princess Peach or the villainous Bowser are as plentiful as the power-up blocks and green warp pipes that populate the park. Children squeal in delight riding through the immersive Donkey Kong mine cart ride that includes fake jumps and scares, much like the game it’s based on, “Donkey Kong Country.” Little girls crowd around to talk to Princess Peach with her wide set of recorded responses.\nRobert Martinez Jr., the 43-year-old executive chef at the park’s Toadstool Cafe restaurant, understands the generational love of Nintendo. He’s a 25-year veteran of Universal Orlando, a job passed on from his chef father who worked at the park.\n“It’s surreal to see myself as a young kid with my Nintendo, blowing the cartridges as we all did back in the day, to being here. Nintendo as a brand touches so many generations,” Martinez said. “It’s something I can share with my kids today. In many cases, you probably know the IP way more than your kid.”\nSeeing those families enjoy the park is “something that really brings me joy,” Miyamoto said. “At the same time, it makes me feel a little old too.”\nMiyamoto hasn’t misplaced his youthful sense of play. During a photo shoot for The Post, Miyamoto struggled to offer a “business” face when posing. He couldn’t help but crack cherubic smiles as he posed with his fists up like Mario.\nThat playfulness translates throughout the park, which Miyamoto helped design. Each visitor receives wristbands that keep score of activities and secrets discovered, including coins collected by punching blocks.\n“I created this theme park with the hope that people will be able to experience Nintendo characters with their entire body,” he said. “There was a time where I was thinking, ‘I wish we could create an interactive experience where people can roll around and hang out.’ ”\nNintendo is a famously stubborn company. It started in the 19th century as a producer of playing cards and later as a toy company. Miyamoto’s work transformed its focus to video games and consoles, a formula it has strictly followed until recent years. It is the only major platform holder that does not publish its games in competing platforms, unlike PlayStation and Microsoft’s Xbox, which now both publish games on Nintendo’s Switch consoles. That strategy has helped keep Nintendo unusually profitable.\nSo for years, Nintendo was precious with its intellectual property, keeping Mario and crew away from multimedia projects, outside of the first attempt at a Mario movie, which was a notorious box-office bomb.\n“Our thinking was that we don’t use characters in media other than games so we’re not limited or restricted when we create the next game,” he said. That freedom encouraged creativity: depicting Mario flying with a raccoon tail in “Super Mario 3,” or in the following game, riding the dinosaur Yoshi.\n“Over the decades, that thinking has changed inside of me, in that I’ve come to realize there are limits to the reach that these Nintendo characters can have when we are just focusing on games,” Miyamoto said. “For example, there are countries where maybe there aren’t games available. It really translated into being able to expand through different media.”\nMiyamoto said he guided Universal on creating a more interactive experience that’s approachable and family friendly, while keeping the spirit of his games. The puzzle series Pikmin, which began in 2001, is one of the last properties Miyamoto helped create, and it remains among his most beloved. The plantlike Pikmin creatures are meant to be ethereal and spiritual, and it was Miyamoto’s idea to place them all over the park as part of a hide-and-seek game.\n“When you look at characters like Mario or Splatoon, I made it a point to make sure they only exist within the IPs they are a part of, but Pikmin have this unique quality in that they can be right next to you as we speak,” Miyamoto said. “They can, at least in my mind, interact and mingle with any kind of IP. I thought the easiest and quickest way to really convey what Pikmin is was to just drop Pikmin in that world.”\nThe magnitude of Nintendo and Universal’s achievement only hit Miyamoto when he walked out of the warp pipe and saw the park envelop him. It’s the real-world equivalent of hero Link stepping out into the world of Hyrule in the groundbreaking 2017 Nintendo Switch game, “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.”\n“I’ve been obviously looking at everything from the schematic and planning stage,” he said. “When it comes to finally taking the blocks we so painstakingly created and stacking those up, recreating Mount Beanpole, adding the moving Piranha Plants or Goombas and having them all synchronized together … and then walking out of Peach Castle and looking ahead at the world, that was when I found myself thinking, ‘Wow.’”\nDespite Nintendo’s expansion into other mediums, Miyamoto said it’s important for the firm’s employees to remember that they are entertainers. It’s why he helped open the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, not just as a visitor attraction but as a document to inspire employees.\n“I wanted to make sure it’s clear Nintendo isn’t trying to compete with competitors as a game company, but as an entertainment company, looking for new technologies, to expand and create new experiences,” he said.\nMiyamoto said when it comes to his legacy, he’s not sure if “satisfaction” is exactly the right word for it. His first real dream was to become a manga artist and storyteller.\n“Through manga, I wanted to create a unique world. Obviously I didn’t become a manga artist,” he said. “But I really can’t help but feel very fortunate that through my involvement with creating games, I’ve been able to expand that process to something like the theme park you see today.”\nIt wasn’t the road Miyamoto started on, but as he mused earlier, the world really does work in mysterious ways."

        "article_text": "A massive five-hour regional power outage on the day of the Cannes Film Festival closing ceremony gave new meaning to “if there’s a will, there’s a way.”\nSomehow, electricity was restored just in time for a moment that those present will never forget: Jafar Panahi winning the Palme d’Or.\nThe Iranian dissident director, who has been jailed twice in his country and until April 2023 was serving a 20-year ban from traveling or making films, won for “It Was Just An Accident” — a riveting political thriller in which a group of former prisoners kidnap and confront the guard who tortured them. But do they have the right guy? Panahi, freed after serving 14 years of that ban, still made the film in secret to avoid his government’s required script approval and other rules, like requiring all the women in the film to wear hijabs.\nPanahi’s presence at the festival made international news, and he was greeted with a rare prescreening standing ovation the moment he walked into the theater for the film’s premiere.\nWhen his name was called at the awards ceremony, the theater erupted with one of the most sustained roars this Cannes veteran has ever witnessed.\n“Art mobilizes creative energy — the most precious, lively part of us — a strength which enables us to turn darkness into pardon, hope, new life,” jury president Juliette Binoche said, explaining why they’d chosen Panahi’s film for the festival’s top prize.\nCate Blanchett warned against allowing “the self-serving world of national and political ambition” to co-opt cinema, before handing the director his Palme.\nIn his speech, Panahi made a plea to Iranians around the world. “Let us set aside all our differences and problems. What’s most important now is our country and the freedom of our country,” he said. “Let us join forces. No one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do.”\nThis marks distributor Neon’s sixth Palme d’Or, following films such as “Anora,” “Anatomy of a Fall” and “Parasite,” and immediately puts Panahi’s film in the Oscar conversation.\nBrazilian director Kleber Mendonça Filho was another big winner with “The Secret Agent,” a lively, funny and sometimes surrealist visual feast about the lives of political exiles under his country’s military dictatorship of 1977, and set during Carnival. It took home prizes for best director and best actor — marking a return for Brazilian star Wagner Moura (“Civil War,” “Narcos”). The film is already being compared to last year’s Oscars darling “I’m Still Here,” but Mendonça Filho’s film has a far more mischievous tone and even features a sequence in which a hairy severed leg, enacting the oppressions of the regime, goes around kicking couples at a gay cruising site.\nDanish Norwegian director Joachim Trier won the Grand Prix, or second place, for “Sentimental Value” — his deeply felt story of family trauma, starring Stellan Skarsgård as a filmmaker who asks his partially estranged daughter (Renate Reinsve, who won best actress at Cannes in 2021 with Trier’s “The Worst Person in the World”) to star in a film about his mother’s suicide.\nThe third-place jury prize was a tie between French Moroccan director Oliver Laxe’s “Sirât” and German director Mascha Schilinski’s “Sound of Falling.” The former is an ominous “Mad Max”-adjacent odyssey in which a group of drifters travel through the Moroccan desert in search of raves during what may be the end of the world. The latter is a complex tale of joy and brutality among four generations of women in a rural German village. Both were among thebuzziest films of the festival.\nThe jury spent 11 days deliberating on 22 competition films. Joining Binoche were American actors Jeremy Strong and Halle Berry, Italian actress Alba Rohrwacher, French Moroccan writer and journalist Leila Slimani, Indian director Payal Kapadia, Mexican director Carlos Reygadas, Congolese director Dieudo Hamadi and South Korean director Hong Sang-soo.\nAs for the power outage, it was reportedlycaused by deliberate sabotage to the power grid, forcing the closure of restaurants and cafes and causing a massive traffic jam after streetlights went off.\nAt the festival’s headquarters, the Palais, a screening of “Sirât” was shut down for seven minutes before an emergency power source kicked in. The news conference for Kelly Reichardt’s “The Mastermind” was able to continue on schedule, to the relief of the many fans who gathered outside the press room for a glimpse of star Josh O’Connor.\nFrench media reported a suspected arson overnight at an electricity station in Tanneron, a town southwest of Cannes, followed by the deliberate downing of electrical pylons that had been sawed through in multiple other towns surrounding Cannes. Police are investigating the attack, which left 160,000 households in the dark, the French electricity network operator RTE said on X.\nThe power, thankfully, came back on a few hours before the start of the closing ceremony, which featured a surprise moment in which John C. Reilly sang “La Vie en Rose,” for no reason than just because.\nHere is the full list of winners:\nPalme d’Or:Jafar Panahi, “It Was Just an Accident”\nGrand Prix:Joachim Trier, “Sentimental Value”\nJoint Jury Prize:Oliver Laxe, “Sirât” AND Mascha Schilinski, “Sound of Falling”\nBest Director:Kleber Mendonça Filho, “The Secret Agent”\nBest Screenplay:“The Young Mother’s Home,” Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne\nBest Actor:Wagner Moura, “The Secret Agent” (directed by Kleber Mendonça Filho)\nBest Actress:Nadia Melliti, “The Little Sister” (directed by Hafsia Herzi)\nSpecial Award (Prix Spécial):Bi Gan, “Resurrection”\nCamera d’Or:“The President’s Cake,” Hasan Hadi (played in Director’s Fortnight)\nCamera d’Or Special Mention:“My Father’s Shadow,” Akinola Davies Jr.\nShort Film Palme d’Or:“I’m Glad You’re Dead Now,” Tawfeek Barhom\nShort Film Special Mention:“Ali,” Adnan Al Rajeev\nGolden Eye Documentary Prize:“Imago,” Déni Oumar Pitsaev\nGolden Eye Special Jury Prize:“The Six Billion Dollar Man,” Eugene Jarecki\nQueer Palm:“The Little Sister,” Hafsia Herzi\nPalme Dog:Panda, “The Love That Remains”\nFIPRESCI Award (Competition):“The Secret Agent,” Kleber Mendonça Filho\nFIPRESCI Award (Un Certain Regard):“Urchin,” Harris Dickinson\nFIPRESCI Award (Parallel Sections):“Dandelion’s Odyssey,” Momoko Seto\nUn Certain Regard Award:“The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo,” Diego Céspedes\nJury Prize:“A Poet,” Simón Mesa Soto\nBest Director Prize:Arab and Tarzan Nasser, “Once Upon a Time in Gaza”\nBest Actor:Frank Dillane, “Urchin” (directed by Harris Dickinson)\nBest Actress:Cleo Diára, “I Only Rest in the Storm” (directed by Pedro Pinho)\nBest Screenplay:Harry Lighton, “Pillion”\nSpecial Mention:“Norah,” Tawfik Alzaidi\nDIRECTORS’ FORTNIGHT\nAudience Choice Award:“The President’s Cake,” Hasan Hadi\nEuropa Cinemas Label:“Wild Foxes,” Valéry Carnoy\nSociety of Dramatic Authors and Composers Prize for Best French feature:“Wild Foxes,” Valéry Carnoy\nGrand Prize:“A Useful Ghost,” Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke\nFrench Touch Prize:“Imago,” Déni Oumar Pitsaev\nGAN Foundation Award for Distribution:Le Pacte, “Left-Handed Girl”\nLouis Roederer Foundation Rising Star Award:Théodore Pellerin, “Nino”\nLeitz Cine Discovery Prize (short film):“L’mina,” Randa Maroufi\nSociety of Dramatic Authors and Composers Prize:Guillermo Galoe and Victor Alonso-Berbel, authors of “Sleepless City”\nCanal+ Short Film Award:“Erogenesis,” Xandra Popescu\n“From Dust,” created by Michel van der Aa"

        "article_text": "It was just after noon on Friday when Blair Nixon got the call. The queer bar he co-owned and managed, Sinners and Saints, had been broken into.\nNixon rushed to his bar in Adams Morgan in Northwest Washington. When he arrived, he stepped over the broken glass from the shattered front door and surveyed the damage: missing bottles of alcohol, the building’s electricity shut off, the back door ajar. And, scrawled in black paint on the white wall, a homophobic slur.\nNixon said he called D.C. police.\n“It’s really disheartening,” said Nixon, who describes Sinners and Saints as the city’s only bar that caters to queer and trans people of color. “If you have somebody who’s in your space who isn’t supposed to be there, it’s scary.”\nThe vandalism comes as D.C. hosts WorldPride, anLGBTQ+ festival celebrating “diversity, equality and love on a global scale,” that hopes to bring millions to Washington from May 17 to June 8. The attack alsooccurred duringD.C. Black Pride, which is being celebrated this weekend.\nD.C. police are investigating the break-in as a suspected hate crime, according to the police report.An employee at the restaurant above Sinners and Saints arrived at work Friday to find the building without power, headed downstairs to the bar to investigate, then noticed the shattered glass and called Nixon, the report says.\nNixon said he’s been impressed by the city’s response — police sent multiple detectives to investigate, as well as an LGBTQ+ liaison. The mayor’s office also reached out to discuss ways to ensure the bar and its tenants felt protected. No arrest had been made as of Saturday afternoon.\nIt felt as if the entire city rallied around the bar, Nixon said, especially after the Sinners and Saints team decided to share photos of the vandalism on social media on Friday.\n“To the coward who broke in and scribbled slurs: your fear is loud but our pride is louder,” theposton Sinners and Saints’ Instagram account read. “This space remains queer, defiant, and beautifully unbothered.”\nThe post garnered more than a hundred comments, many of them from neighbors offering to paint a mural over the slur, help with repairs or stand guard outside the bar.\nSome national figures also chimedin. RuPaul’s Drag Race star Laganja Estranja commented, “Incredible response! I believe in you. Sending so much love and strength.”\nPeter Wood, an advisory neighborhood commissioner for Adams Morgan, condemned the vandalism, adding that it occurred during a particularly tense political moment in D.C. Following the Trump administration’s targeting of transgender rights, some international LGBTQ+ groups haveexpressed concernsover attending WorldPride. In late April, the Capital Pride Alliance, which is organizing WorldPride,relocatedsome of its events from the Kennedy Center, where President Donald Trump has installed himself as chairman. The organization said it did so “to ensure our entire LGBTQ+ community will be welcome.”\n“Everyone’s on edge and this makes people even more on edge,” Wood said. “I feel confidently that the Adams Morgan community is very resilient and strong and will organize, so we’ll survive. But people want to be able to just be happy — it’s a very baseline request and even that feels like it’s being threatened on a daily basis.”\nNixon estimated damages to Sinners and Saintswill exceed $5,000. A GoFundMe to replace the stolen alcohol and repair the property damage raised almost $1,500 in the 24 hours after the break-in. He said the vandalism only further proves the necessity of a bar for queer and trans Black and Indigenous people and people of color.\n“D.C. has one of the biggest queer communities in the entire world and what’s important to note is that the acceptance of the LGBT community has been amazing,” Nixon said. “However, just like many other situations, the acceptance of people of the color and the trans community is lagging behind and our entire mission is to provide a space where underrepresented and marginalized communities within the greater LGBT community can feel safe.”\nJust twelve hours after Nixon arrived at the bar to find shattered glass, dozens of people packed the bar’s dance floor to celebrate Black Pride.\n“It was really important to us to stay open,” Nixon said. “We don’t ever want to send the message that we can be repressed. We don’t want to be shaken, we don’t want to be down, we want to be sure we stick to our mission.”\nThe slur remains scrawled on the wall. The Sinners and Saints owners are considering framing it, Nixon said, as a reminder of the time someone tried to shame them and failed."
