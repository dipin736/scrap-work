    "date": "Updated 06:44 PM GMT+5:30, May 06, 2025",
    "article": "BERLIN (AP) — German lawmakers are set to vote on the country’s next chancellor again on Tuesday afternoon, hours afterconservative leader Friedrich Merzfailed to win the first round in parliament in a historic defeat.\nMerz, the conservative leader, had been expected to sail through the vote to become the 10th chancellor since World War II. No postwar candidate for chancellor has ever failed to win on the first ballot.\nMerz needed a majority of 316 out of 630 votes but only got 310. Because the first-round vote was a secret ballot, it was not immediately clear — and might never be known — who had defected from Merz’s camp.\nHe is still likely to take the top job after the government of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholzcollapsed last yearand a national election was held in February. Despite his official farewell on Monday, Scholz remains in a caretaker capacity until a new chancellor takes over.\nMerz’s coalition is led by his center-right Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union. They are joined by Scholz’s center-left Social Democrats.\nUpon announcing the next vote, the head of the Union bloc in parliament, Jens Spahn, said that “the whole of Europe, perhaps even the whole world, is watching this second round of elections.”\nGermany, the most populous member state of the27-nation European Union, hasthe continent’s biggest economyand serves as a diplomatic heavyweight. The new chancellor’s in-tray would includethe war in Ukraineand theTrump administration’s confrontational trade policyon top of domestic issues, such as therise of a far-right, anti-immigrant party.\nIf Merz fails to win election in the second round, the lower house of parliament — the Bundestag — has 14 days to elect a candidate with an absolute majority. Merz can run repeatedly but other lawmakers can also throw their hat in the ring. There is no limit to the number of votes that can be held within the two-week period.\nIf Merz or any other candidate fails to secure a majority within those 14 days, the constitution allows for the president to appoint the candidate who wins the most votes as chancellor, or to dissolve the Bundestag and hold a new national election.\nJohann Wadepuhl, the foreign minister-designate, said he was confident Merz would ultimately prevail.\n“It is an annoying process, but in a parliamentary democracy, in a liberal country, this is unfortunately one of the scenarios that you have to be prepared for,” he told reporters.\nMerz’s biographer, Volker Resing, said that if Merz wins in the second round, everything will be fine and people may soon forget about the first-round hiccup.\nAlice Weidel, co-leader of the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party, slammed Merz’s failure as proof that his coalition has a “weak foundation” and called for fresh elections.\nAfD is the biggest opposition party in Germany’s new parliament after it placedsecond in February’s elections. Despite its historic gains, it was shut out of coalition talks due to the so-called “firewall” that mainstream German political parties have upheld against cooperating with far-right parties since the end of the war.\nTuesday’s voting came on the eve of the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s unconditional surrender in World War II. The ballots are cast in the restored Reichstag building, where graffiti left by victorious Soviet troops has been preserved at several locations.\nThe shadow of the war in Ukraine also loomed over Tuesday’s vote. Germany is the second-biggest supplier ofmilitary aid to Ukraine, after the United States.\nOverall, Germany is the fourth largest defense spender in the world, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which studies trends in global military expenditures. Only the U.S., China and Russia are ahead.\nGermany rose to that rank thanks to an investment of 100 billion euros ($107 billion) for its armed forces, a measure passed by lawmakers in 2022.\nDefense spending rose again earlier this year, when parliament loosened the nation’s strict debt rules. It’s a move that’s been closely watched by the rest of Europe as the Trump administration has threatened to pull back from its security support on the continent.\nBesides ramping up defense spending, Merz’s coalition has pledged to spur economic growth, takea tougher approach to migrationandcatch up on long-neglected modernization..\nThe U.S. administration has bashed Germany repeatedly since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. Trump, who has German roots, often expressed his dislike of former Chancellor Angela Merkel during his first term in office.\nThis time around, Trump’s lieutenants are at the forefront — tech billionaire and Trump ally ElonMusk has supported AfD for months. He hosted a chat with Weidel that he livestreamed on X earlier this year to amplify her party’s message.\nVice President JD Vance, during the Munich Security Conference in February, assailed the“firewall” and later met with Weidel, a move that German officials heavily criticized.\nLast week, the German domestic intelligence service said it has classified AfDas a “right-wing extremist” organization, making it subject to greater and broader surveillance.\nThe decision by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution prompted blowback fromU.S. Secretary of State Marco RubioandVanceover the weekend.Germany’s Foreign Ministryhit back at Rubio after he called on the country to drop the classification.\nThe domestic intelligence service’s measure does not amount to a ban of the party, which can only take place through a request by either of parliament’s two chambers or the federal government through the Federal Constitutional Court.\nMerz has not commented publicly on the intelligence service’s decision.\nGermany’s economy has shrunk for the past two years and is forecast by the outgoing government to see zero growth this year. The stock market slid following the vote: the DAX, the index of major German companies, was down 1.8% at one point.\nThe next government is expected to end months of paralysis and squabbling over government spending and economic policy that plagued Scholz’s coalition, and also add new impetus for growth with tax cuts and infrastructure spending.\n___\nAssociated Press videojournalist Fanny Brodersen in Berlin and writer David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, contributed to this report.",

    "date": "Updated 02:03 AM GMT+5:30, May 06, 2025",
    "article": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel approved plans Monday to seizethe Gaza Stripand to stay inthe Palestinian territoryfor an unspecified amount of time, two Israeli officials said, a move that, if implemented, would vastly expandIsrael’s operations thereand likely draw fierce international opposition.\nThe new plan, which was approved in an early morning vote by Israeli Cabinet ministers, also calls for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to move to Gaza’s south. That would likely amount to their forcible displacement and exacerbate an already dire humanitarian crisis.\nAn Israeli army tank maneuvers in the Gaza Strip is seen from southern Israel, Sunday, May 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)\n\nDetails of the plan were not formally announced, and its exact timing and implementation were not clear. Its approval came hours after the Israeli military chief said the army was calling up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers. The plan may be another measure by Israel to try to pressure Hamas into making concessions in ceasefire negotiations.\nA third person, a defense official, said the new plan would not begin until after U.S. President Donald Trump wraps up his expected visit to the Middle East this month, allowing for the possibility that Israel might agree to a ceasefire in the meantime. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing military plans.\nAP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on Israel’s new plan to take over the whole of Gaza and stay there indefinitely.\n\nPalestinians struggle to get donated food at a community kitchen in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, Monday, May 5, 2025. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)\n\nLater Monday, the Israeli militarytargeted Houthi rebelsin Yemen’s Red Sea city of Hodeida with a punishing round of airstrikes. The strikes came a day after the Iranian-backed rebelslaunched a missilethat hit Israel’s main airport. The rebels’ media office said at least six strikes hit the Hodeida port. Other strikes hit a cement factory, the rebels said.\n\nIsrael withdrew from Gaza in 2005 after a decades-long occupation and then imposed a blockade on the territory along with Egypt. Capturing and potentially occupying the territory again for an indefinite period would not only further dash hopes for Palestinian statehood, it would embed Israel inside a population that is deeply hostile to it and raise questions about how Israel plans to govern the territory, especially at a time when it is considering how to implementTrump’s vision to take over Gaza.\nSinceIsrael ended a ceasefire with the Hamas militant groupin mid-March, Israel has unleashed fierce strikes on the territory that have killed hundreds. It has captured swaths of territory andnow controls roughly 50%of Gaza. Before the truce ended, Israelhalted all humanitarian aid into the territory, including food, fuel and water, setting off what is believed to the be the worst humanitarian crisis in nearly 19 months of war.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages. Israel says 59 captives remain in Gaza, although about 35 are believed to be dead.\nIsrael’s offensive has displaced more than 90% of Gaza’s population and, Palestinian health officials say, killed more than 52,000 people there, many of them women and children. The officials do not distinguish between combatants and civilians in their count.\nA morgue worker places the body of a child among the bodies of other victims killed in at least two separate Israeli army strikes, ahead of a burial ceremony outside Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, Monday, May 5, 2025. (AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi)\n\nAt least 42 people were killed by Israeli strikes from Sunday through Monday afternoon, according to hospitals and the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza. The Israeli military offered no immediate comment on the strikes.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday cabinet ministers had decided on a “powerful operation in Gaza,” including “a movement of the population to protect it.”\nThe plan also imposes Israeli control over aid distribution. Israel accuses Hamas of diverting aid for its own use or to distribute to strengthen its rule in Gaza, though Israel has not provided evidence. A spokesman for the U.N. humanitarian office, Jens Laerke, denied there was significant diversion of aid, saying the U.N. employs “a solid system to monitor and prevent” such theft.\nThe officials said Israel wasin touch with several countriesabout Trump’s plan to take over Gaza and relocate its population, under what Israel has termed “voluntary emigration.” That proposal has drawn widespread condemnation, including from Israel’s allies in Europe, and rights groups have warned it could be a war crime under international law.\nFor weeks, Israel has been trying to ratchet up pressure on Hamas to get the group to agree to its terms in ceasefire negotiations. But the measures do not appear to have moved Hamas away from its negotiating positions.\nThe previous ceasefire was meant to lead the sidesto negotiate an end to the war, but that has remained elusive. Israel says it will not agree to end the war until Hamas’ governing and military capabilities are dismantled. Hamas, meanwhile, has sought an agreement that winds down the war without agreeing to disarm.\nIsrael’s expansion announcement angered families of hostages who fear that any extension of the conflict endangers their loved ones. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which supports families, urged Israel’s decision-makers to prioritize the hostages and secure a deal quickly.\nAt a Knesset committee meeting Monday, Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is being held hostage, called on soldiers “not to report for reserve duty for moral and ethical reasons.”\nSome reservistshave indicated they will refuse to serve in a war they increasingly view as politically motivated.\nPalestinians struggle to get donated food at a community kitchen in Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, Monday, May 5, 2025. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)\n\n\n\nThe defense official said the plan would “separate” Hamas from the aid by using private firms and by using specified areas secured by the Israeli military. The official added that Palestinians would be screened to prevent Hamas from accessing the aid.\nAccording to a memo circulated among aid groups and seen by The Associated Press, Israel told the United Nations that it will useprivate security companiesto control aid distribution in Gaza. The U.N., in a statement Sunday, said it would not participate in the plan as presented, saying it violates its core principles.\nThe memo summarized a meeting between the Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, called COGAT, and the U.N. It was written by a group briefed on the meeting and sent Sunday to aid organizations.\nAccording to the memo, under COGAT’s plan, all aid will enter Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing, on approximately 60 trucks daily, and be distributed directly to people. Some 500 trucks entered Gaza every day before the war.\nThe memo said that facial-recognition technology will be used to identify Palestinians at logistics hubs and text message alerts will notify people in the area that they can collect aid.\nCOGAT did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDisplaced Palestinians walk through a makeshift tent camp in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis, in the Gaza Strip, on Monday, May 5, 2025. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)\n\n\n\nAfter Israel said it was going to assert more control over aid distribution in Gaza, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs sent an email to aid groups, urging them to reject any “draconian restrictions on humanitarian work.”\nThe email, which OCHA sent Monday to aid groups and was shared with the AP, further stated that there are mechanisms in place to ensure aid is not diverted.\nEarlier, OCHA said in a statement that the plan would leave large parts of the population, including the most vulnerable, without supplies. It said the plan “appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic — as part of a military strategy.”\nAid groups have said they are opposed to using any armed or uniformed personnel to distribute aid that could potentially intimidate Palestinians or put them at risk.\nHamas decried Israel’s efforts to control distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza as a violation of international law.\nIn a statement Monday, the militant group said the effort is “an extension of the starvation policy” adopted by the Israeli government in Gaza.\n___\nMednick reported from Jerusalem.

    "article": "All four international airports around Moscow temporarily suspended flights Tuesday as Russian forces intercepted more than 100 Ukrainian drones fired at almost a dozen Russian regions, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said.\nNine other regional Russian airports also temporarily stopped operating as drones struck areas along the border with Ukraine and deeper inside Russia, according to Russia’s civil aviation agency, Rosaviatsia, and the Defense Ministry. It was the second straight night that the Moscow region reportedly was targeted.\nThe drone assault threatened a plannedunilateral 72-hour ceasefirein themore than three-year warannounced by President Vladimir Putin to coincide with celebrations in Moscow marking Victory Day in World War II.\nThe day celebrating Moscow’s defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 is Russia’s biggest secular holiday. Chinese President Xi Jinping, Brazilian leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and others will gather in the Russian capital on Thursday for the 80th anniversary and watch a parade featuring thousands of troops accompanied by tanks and missiles.\nUkraine’s Foreign Ministry urged foreign countries not to send military representatives to take part in the parade, as some have in the past. None is officially confirmed for this year’s event.\nUkraine will regard the participation of foreign military personnel as “an affront to the memory of the victory over Nazism, to the memory of millions of Ukrainian front-line soldiers who liberated our country and all of Europe from Nazism eight decades ago,” a statement on the ministry’s website said.\n\nSecurity is expected to be tight. Russian officials have warned that internet access could be restricted in Moscow during the celebrations and have told residents not to set off fireworks.\nPutin last week declared the brief unilateral truce “on humanitarian grounds” from May 8. Ukraine has demanded a longer ceasefire.\nRussia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day halt in the fighting by insisting on far-reaching conditions. Ukraine has accepted that proposal, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that the brief truce “doesn’t sound like much, but it’s … a lot if you knew where we started from.”\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that ceasefire orders had been issued to Russian troops but soldiers would retaliate if fired upon.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine and Russia swapped hundreds of captured soldiers in one of the largest exchanges since Moscow’s full-scale invasion started in February 2022. The last exchange was on April 19.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia’s Ministry of Defense said they each received 205 soldiers in the swap. Both sides said the United Arab Emirates had mediated the exchange, as on previous occasions.\nThe long-range strikes by both sides continued, however. Ukraine has used increasingly sophisticated, domestically produced drones to compensate for having a smaller army than Russia along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, and to take the war onto Russian soil with long-range strikes.\nRussia has used Shahed drones as well as 3,000-pound (1,300-kilogram) glide bombs, artillery and cruise and ballistic missiles against Ukraine.\nTwo people were injured in Russia’s Kursk region, according to local Gov. Alexander Khinshtein, and some damage was reported in the Voronezh region.\nThe Russian reports couldn’t be independently verified.\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian air force said Russia fired 136 strike and decoy drones overnight.\nRussian forces fired at least 20 Shahed drones at Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city near the border with Russia, injuring four people, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov wrote on Telegram.\nThe drones started a fire at the biggest market in Kharkiv, Barabashovo, destroying and damaging around 100 market stalls, he said.\nSeven civilians were hurt elsewhere in the Kharkiv region by Russian glide bombs and drones, Syniehubov said.\nIn Kramatorsk, in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, Russian Shahed drones killed one person and injured two others, Mayor Oleksandr Honcharenko wrote on Facebook. The drones targeted residential and industrial areas of the city, he said.\nIn the Odesa region, Russian drones struck residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, killing one person, regional head Oleh Kiper wrote on Telegram.\n___\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine athttps://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "headline": "Canadian Prime Minister Carney will meet with President Trump, hoping to ease trade war tensions",
    "date": "Updated 06:46 PM GMT+5:30, May 06, 2025",
    "article": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Canada’s new prime minister, Mark Carney, won the job with a promise to confront the increased aggression shown by President Donald Trump — and he’ll have the opportunity to do that in a face-to-face Oval Office meeting on Tuesday.\nTrump has shattered a decades-old alliance by saying he wants to make Canada the 51st U.S. state and levying steep tariffs against an essential partner in the manufacturing of autos and the supply of oil, electricity and other goods. The outrage provoked by Trump enabled Carney’s Liberal Party to scorea stunning comeback victorylast month as the ongoing trade war andattacks on Canadian sovereigntyhave outraged voters.\nThe Republican president has repeatedly threatened that he intends to make Canadathe “51st state.”He said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” that aired Sunday that the border is an “artificial line” that prevents the two territories from forming a “beautiful country.”\nTrump’s openly adversarial approach has raised questions for Carney and other world leaders on how to manage relations with the U.S. Some world leaders, such as the United Kingdom’s prime minister, Keir Starmer,engaged in a charm offensive. Others, such as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, weremet by Trump with angerfor not being sufficiently deferential.\nRobert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, said Carney shouldn’t meet with Trump.\n\n“We’ve seen what he does. We saw what he did with Zelenskyy,” Bothwell said. “And he would sure as hell try to do the same with Carney. It’s not in Carney’s interest. It’s not in Canada’s interest.”\nTrump and Carney will meet in the Oval Office and have lunch. Carney has stressed that he was elected to specifically “stand up” to the U.S. president and that Canada is “in a once-in-a-lifetime crisis.” Carney said he expects “difficult” but “constructive” conversations with his U.S. counterpart.\nTrump told reporters on Monday that he wasn’t quite sure why Carney was visiting.\n“I’m not sure what he wants to see me about,” Trump said. “But I guess he wants to make a deal.”\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnickfurther stoked doubts about their interest in repairing the relationship with Canada in a Monday interview on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow” show.\nAsked if the U.S. could make a deal with Canada, Lutnick called the country a “socialist regime” that has been “basically feeding off America.” Lutnick said Tuesday’s meeting would be “fascinating.”\nCarney, at a Friday news conference ahead of his trip, said the talks would focus on immediate trade pressures and the broader economic and national security relationships. He said his “government would fight to get the best deal for Canada” and “take all the time necessary” to do so, even as Canada pursues a parallel set of talks to deepen relations with other allies and lessen its commitments with the U.S.\nTrump has maintained that the U.S. doesn’t need anything from Canada. He is actively going after a Canadian auto sector built largely by U.S. companies, saying, “They’re stopping work in Mexico, and they’re stopping work in Canada, and they’re all moving here.” He also said the U.S. doesn’t need Canada’s energy — though nearly one-fourth of the oil that the U.S. consumes daily comes from the province of Alberta.\nThe president has also disparaged Canada’s military commitments despite a partnership that ranges from the beaches of Normandy in World War II to remote stretches of Afghanistan.\nTrump has said that Canada spends “less money on military than practically any nation in the world.”\n“They pay NATO less than any nation,” he said. “They think we are subsidizing. They think we are going to protect them, and, really, we are. But the truth is, they don’t carry their full share, and it’s unfair to the United States and our taxpayers.”\nBothwell noted that Carney might be under little pressure to reach a quick deal as Trump has at timesreversed, delayed or defanged his tariffs, such that over time Trump might be in a weaker position if talks are prolonged.\n“It may not matter as much in the summer as it does today because every time he’s made one of these announcements, next week it’s, ‘Oh, I had my fingers crossed. I didn’t mean it,’” he said of Trump.\nDaniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University, said Carney needed the quickly scheduled meeting with Trump to address the trade war started by the U.S. Trump has imposed25% tariffs on steel and aluminumand tariffs on other products outside the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in some cases ostensibly to address relatively low volumes of fentanyl intercepted at the border between the two countries.\n“Carney wants to show that he’s doing everything he can, including taking political risks to protect Canadian jobs in areas such as the auto industry,” Béland said. ”If he had postponed his first meeting with President Trump for months and months, opposition parties and commentators could have accused him of being overly shy and doing a disservice to Canada because of that.”\nCanada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada.\nCanada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S.",

The index broke a nine-day winning streak a day earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 255 points, or 0.6%. The Nasdaq composite lost 1%. The declines came on the first day of a two-day meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers, where the central bank is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady. The Fed cut rates three times last year. Uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariffs has officials concerned about a potential resurgence of inflation.\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.\nWall Street is pointing toward losses Tuesday ahead of a two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve, which is facing the diametrically opposed challenges ofpotential inflationand asoftening employment landscape.\nFutures for the S&P 500 lost 0.7% and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 0.6%. Nasdaq futures slid 1%.\nThe Fed is expected to hold itsbenchmark interest rate steadyfor the third consecutive meeting after trimming them three times to close out 2024. Uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s trade policy — namely tariffs — has officials concerned about a potential resurgence of inflation, which has been hovering just above the Fed’s target rate of 2%.\nTheU.S. economyshrank 0.3% in the first quarter, the first drop in three years.\n\nAfter enormous sell-offs with the market roiling from back-and-forth tariff announcements from the White House, Wall Street had been on a nine-day winning streak, its longest since 2004. That momentum lost steam Monday and the S&P 500 fell 0.6%.\nThis week’s pause coincides with a growing number of U.S. corporations pulling guidance do to uncertainty about what the tariffs will bring, and spelling out the economic hits they’ll take.\nShares ofFord Motor Co. fell 2.5% before the bell after the automaker said Monday it expects to take a $1.5 billion hit to its operating profit from tariffs this year. That followed General Motors, which last weektrimmed its 2025 guidanceand said it was anticipating a potential $5 billion tariff impact\nClorox sank 3.2% after it missed sales and profit targets in its most recent quarter and lowered its forecast to reflect “macroeconomic uncertainty” related to tariffs.\nDoorDash tumbled more than 5% in premarket after the food delivery app said it was acquiringBritain’s Deliveroo for 2.9 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) in cash, expanding its business in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\nIn reporting its most recent financial results, DoorDash said demand for deliveries remained strong in the first quarter, even as more Americansfeel increasingly uneasy about the U.S. economy.\nElsewhere, markets in China advanced after reopening from “Golden Week” holidays.\nWhen asked at a routine briefing about comments Trump’s comments on NBC that he won’t cancel tariffs on China to pave the way for trade talks, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson reiterated Beijing’s stance that the U.S. “should stop threatening and pressuring and engage in dialogue with China on the basis of equality, respect, and mutual benefit.”\n“If they want to fight, we will fight to the end; if they want to talk, the door is open,” Lin Jian said.\nLate last week, China’s Commerce Ministry said it was evaluating various U.S. missives about holding talks.\nThe Shanghai Composite index added 1% to 3,311.89, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was up 0.7% at 22,651.65.\nA monthly survey measuring future activity in China’s services sector fell to its lowest level ever, excluding the pandemic, in a further sign the escalation of Trump’s trade war is hitting the world’s second-largest economy.\nA drastic increase in tariffs on U.S. imports of Chinese products, to 145%, has caused a sharp drop in shipping and other logistics.\n“Overall optimism among Chinese firms weakened to the lowest level since this series began in April 2012, resulting in further job cuts in April,” said the report by Caixin, a financial media group.\nHowever, reports showed a sharp increase in tourism revenues during the holidays that ended Monday, suggesting robust domestic demand, economists said.\nElsewhere in Asia, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.2% to 8,148.40.\nIndia’s Sensex fell 0.2%, while Taiwan’s Taiex slipped less than 0.1%.
