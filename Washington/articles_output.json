        "article_text": "D.C. and the Washington Commanders have reached a $3.7 billion deal to transform the dilapidated RFK Stadium site on the banks of the Anacostia River into a new home for the NFLteam surrounded by retail, housing and park space — a generational development project likely to shape the legacies of Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and Commanders owner Josh Harris.\nSprawling across 177 waterfront acres, the massive development anchored by a covered 65,000-seat stadium would be funded primarily by the Commanders, who would put up $2.7 billion, according to the terms released Monday. The total cost to D.C. taxpayers is expected to top $1 billion, including stadium infrastructure, parking facilities, recreation improvements and other water and electric infrastructure — a price tag likely to spur heated debate on the D.C. Council and among residents about how public money is used.\nAny cost overruns will be covered by the Commanders, Harris said.\nThe council still must approve the deal, and Bowser is expected to include the public financing components in the 2026 capital budget submission in the coming weeks. The team and city are hoping to move quickly. They plan to begin construction next year and have the new stadium open for the 2030 season. That would require the council to approve the terms of the deal by July, and lawmakers could propose changes.\nAt a joint news conference Monday, an elated Bowser took the stage alongside Harris and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to the riffs of Mambo Sauce’s “Welcome to D.C.” with a “WELCOME HOME” banner hanging behind them in Commanders burgundy and gold.\n“This is a big deal. I’ve been working on this for the 10 years since I’ve been mayor, and now we have the right partner at the right time,” Bowser said. “We were joined in our goals to advance a deal that we could be proud of: A development that would serve the city for generations to come and support the best professional sports franchise in the world.”\nThe deal is a significant victory for Bowser, who has staked part of her legacy on major transformations of D.C. sports arenas, from Capital One Arena to RFK. The stadium would also be legacy-defining for Harris, who grew up in Chevy Chase, Maryland, before going to Wall Street andbecoming a billionaire with the means to return his severely damaged favorite team to what he called its “spiritual home.”\n“This project is about so much more than building a stadium,” Harris said. “It’s about a once-in-a-generation opportunity … for long-term transformational economic growth here in D.C.”\nBowser administrationofficials pitched the project as the development of an entirely new neighborhood, replacing cracked asphalt and unused grassy expanses with lively retail, restaurants and recreation opportunities surrounding the stadium, and thousands of residents living in new housing developments.\nThe vision includes several large districts, including the stadium; a plaza district for entertainment and festivals; a riverfront district for housing, retail and restaurants; a new Kingman Park residential district; and an expanded recreation district, where the District plans to build an $89 million SportsPlex next to the Fields at RFK. City officials expect to create 5,000 to 6,000housingunits — 30 percent of which they pledge would be affordable for people living below 30 to 60 percent of the area median income. But officials could not offer details about how they will finance the affordable housing, which may require additional investment.\nUnder the terms of the developmentdeal, the District would put up $500 million toward the stadium development over four years. Officials said the city would finance that portion of the deal by extending the Ballpark Fee, a tax on businesses earning more than $5 million. The fee was expected to expire in 2026, after the city paid off the construction bonds for Nationals Park, officials said. Instead, the city plans to rebrand the fee as the “Sports Facilities Fee” and ask businesses to keep paying, a move that could cause consternation in the business community given that they were expecting the fee to end. The D.C. Chamber of Commerce, for one, announced its support of the Commanders deal.\nIn addition to the half-billion dollars in stadium development costs, taxpayers would pay $202 million for roadways, utilities infrastructure and a transit capacity study on whether transit improvements, such as a new Metro station or entrance, could be needed.\nEventsDC, the city’s convention and sports authority, would put up $181 million for a parking facility, while D.C. would purchase other parking facilities from the Commanders in 2032 for $175 million, a future cost thatis not part of the current financial plan. The city plans to use revenue generated from the stadium to pay for the garage.\nThe parking situation will making tailgating more difficult. The team’s current home — Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland — has about 22,000 parking spaces, while the new stadium will have approximately 8,000, which would all eventually be in a garage.\nA Commanders official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of the announcement, said fans could hang out in the mixed-use areas the team will develop nearby.\nThe Commanders can finance part of their share of the costs through the NFL’s stadium loan program. They are eligible for a loan of as much as $300 million, subject to the approval of team owners.\nThe development opportunity was a product of bipartisan action in Congress last year that gave the city control of the federal property at RFK, and the deal announcement likewise drew bipartisan support Monday.\nPresident Donald Trump cheered the return of the Commanders to the nation’s capital in apost on Truth Social,calling it a “HUGE WIN for Washington, D.C., and for the Team’s incredible fan base.” Rep. James Comer (R-Kentucky), who led the legislation allowing D.C. to redevelop the federal land, said the deal would “unlock the city’s full economic potential,” bringing millions in revenue to city coffers and beautifying the deteriorating property.\nBut only four D.C. Council members attended Monday’s news conference — perhaps indicative of the political battle ahead as Bowser and Harris lobby lawmakers tosupport the deal. Backerswill need seven votes on the 13-member council; Chairman Phil Mendelson (D), who is opposed to public financing of the stadium, said Monday that some lawmakers he has spoken to expected the costs to taxpayers to be “much, much smaller.”\nCouncil member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) put it simply: “It’s not a deal I can support,” he saidin an interview, decrying the high price tag for taxpayers and saying the city can offer retail, recreation, housing and jobs without a stadium.\nCouncil members whoattended Monday’s event gave strong endorsements of the deal. Kenyan R. McDuffie (I-At Large), who chairs the economic development and business committee, called it a “tremendous opportunity” to grow the city’s economy at a time of financial strain. Council member Wendell Felder (D), who represents Ward 7 neighbors surrounding RFK, had been vague about his position on publicly financing a stadium last year, but after seeing the deal said his support was “unequivocal.”\nThe splintered council contrasts with the unity lawmakers showed at the announcement of the $515 million deal to renovate Capital One Arena last year following the collapse of a dealthat would have moved the Capitals and Wizardsfrom D.C. to Virginia — an agreement that lacked buy-in from key Virginia legislators.\nHarris dismissed comparisons to that situation as he lobbies D.C. lawmakers. “It’s going to sell itself,” Harris said. “The council will recognize what an incredible opportunity this is.”\nBowser and Harris alsowill have to contend with opposition from some residents — one group iscollecting signatures for a citywide ballot initiative that would prohibit the construction of a new stadium at RFK, while another has launched a “No Billionaire’s Playground” coalition. Ed Lazere, a representative of the coalition, said in a statement that at a time when the city isfacing intense budget pressure, the city’s $1 billion investment in the stadium development “in a backdoor deal, without community input, shows that the city has its priorities backward.”\nOther neighbors have expressed willingness to discuss the deal. “The dialogue is definitely open,” said Lisa White, former president of the Friends of Kingman Park Civic Association.\nBowser acknowledged some of the divides Monday, including the optics of investing hundreds of millionsof dollars in taxpayer funds in the development while the city is in a financial pinch. D.C. is facing a $1 billion shortfallin its operating budgetover the next several years due largely to federal workforce reductions; expected cuts in the 2026 budget; as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts to the 2025 budget unless Congress fixes a significant funding restraint.\nBut Bowser stressed that the investment in the RFK development,which would be through the capital budget, is separate from the strains on the operating budget that are forcing potential furloughs and facility closures.\n“If you need to add revenue, as we do, you can’t leave 180 acres vacant,” Bowser said. “If you need to add jobs, as we do, you cannot wait for an anchor to show up to start developing there. When you need to attract business, you have to be about business.”\nSeveral aspects of the fan experience at the new stadium remain unclear, such as how much tickets would cost or how much the team would invest in the non-stadium areas over which it would have the development rights. For season tickets, the team plans to institute personal seat licenses (PSLs), meaning fans will have to buy the right to buy their seats — but they can dramatically increase the cost of tickets.\n“We’ll have affordable tickets — even in the context of PSLs,” Harris said.\nThe team has no immediate plans to relocate its corporate headquarters in College Park, Maryland, or its training facility in Ashburn, Virginia. It’s also unclear whether the new stadium would be named after Northwest Federal Credit Union, as the current stadium is, or whether the team would find a new partner.\nThe decision to put a roof on the stadium was not easy, Harris said, because he liked that RFK was outdoors. But he saw it as necessary to attract major events. The new stadium “dramatically” increases the city’s chances of hosting a Super Bowl, Goodell said.\nThe Commanders’ pending departurefrom Marylandrepresents an enormous economic loss to the state’s leaders, who sought to retain the team and the billions it plans to spendon a new stadium. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) said Monday that the state made “a very, very strong offer” to keep the team in Landover, where the Commanders own nearly all of the roughly 200 acres around Northwest Stadium.\n“They were just very clear that they wanted the Washington Commanders in Washington, D.C.,” Moore said.\nBut he struck an optimistic tone that Maryland will ultimately come out ahead: The team has promised to redevelop the land there into what Moore hopes could turn into a new entertainment destination — anything but a rusting, abandoned football stadium like the one RFK had become.\nErin Cox, Jenny Gathright and Mark Maske contributed to this report.\nA previous version of this article incorrectly identified Lisa White as the president of the Friends of Kingman Park Civic Association. She is the former president."

        "article_text": "BLUFFTON, S.C. — Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) once ran a presidential campaign in part on launching a ground war in Syria. He and his best friend in the Senate, John McCain (R-Arizona), toured the world on congressional trips to argue for more U.S. influence and aid abroad before McCain’s death in 2018.\nNow, running for a fifth term in a state that Donald Trump carried by 18 percentage points, the longtime hawk’s foreign policy tone has evolved, to put it lightly.\n“Yeah, I think Europe’s gone woke, don’t y’all?” Graham said to a crowd full of mostly Republican retirees at a town hall earlier this month, after being asked if he agrees with Vice President JD Vance that the United States doesn’t share the same culture and values with European nations’ leaders anymore. He said he wants to be “realistic” about finding an end to the war in Ukraine and Russia, by allowing Russia to retain some of the territory it seized. (Just three years ago, Grahamco-sponsored an effortto ban the U.S. from recognizing any such territory.)\nGraham’s journey on foreign policy has helped him get what he needs to survive his next election in 2026: A Trump endorsement in a state full of Republicans who are often skeptical of him. To keep representing the deep-red state, Graham, the ultimate political survivor, has reinvented himself time and again — sometimes to the chagrin of base voters.\n“I feel like he just flows with the wind. I really do. Which is not a good thing,” said Jane Rabon, 73, a Republican who came to hear Graham speak in the Sun City retirement community. “Sometimes I just want to reach out and smack him.”\nNow, Graham is navigating between the old-school foreign policy views that formed him and the political demands of an increasingly isolationist base, at a time when his close ally Trump is disrupting the geopolitical status quo by threatening to annex an ally, downsizing U.S. diplomacy and levying tariffs on friendly nations. His national-security-minded fellow senators still see Graham as someone who can push for a muscular foreign policy with the president, and Graham remains a loud voice cajoling the administration to take a tougher stance on Iran.\nBut in an interview this month, Graham said his dialogue with Trump — who has railed against NATO and argued that European countries are “ripping off” the United States — has changed how he sees America’s place in the world.\n“I think he has made me reevaluate some of the things I took for granted,” Graham said of the president, soon after addressing the crowd of retirees under a giant projection that touted his endorsement. “That American interventionism has limits. Afghanistan — years and trillions.”\nTrump is right that there’s an “arrogance” to Americans jumping into every problem abroad, the longtime hawk added.\nThat’s a big statement from Graham, who used to be one of the loudest voicescriticizing Trump’s view of America’s placein the world. The senator initially dismissed Trump as a “jackass” when the two were running against each other for the GOP nomination in 2015.The nadir of their relationship was Trump reading out Graham’s private cellphone number at a rally — Graham soon had to get a new phone.\nBut the pair became friends after Trump won, when they started playing golf with each other. That friendship forged on the green has survived clashes on foreign policy and the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, after which Graham said “enough is enough” about his friend in a speech on the floor. (Two years later, he endorsed Trump’s 2024 run for the presidency.)\nGraham argues that Trump is not an isolationist and that while his “America First” foreign policy is not quite Ronald Reagan’s “city on a hill” — it isn’t as far off as some of Trump’s critics believe.\n“He’s not Ronald Reagan in terms of style and rhetoric. But he’s accomplished something that Reagan had accomplished — people are afraid of him,” Graham said. “The power of Trump I’ve come to appreciate.”\nGraham cited NATO countries spending more on their own defense in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — also a core demand of Trump’s — as an example of that power.\n“Trump’s right — hell, they ought to pay more,” Graham said of Europe. “And you know, nobody else could have done that. I love John McCain; I love President Bush. Just name a president — Clinton. None of these people could have done that.”\nGraham said he has also learned to ignore Trump’s style and to focus on the results.  “I don’t care if he takes Putin on vacation, as long as we get a good outcome,” he said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nGraham’s new realpolitik has alienated some of his former fans, particularly as they watched his tone shift on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nGraham has called for billions in aid to the invaded nation in the past and as recently as February praised Ukraine’s wartime leader as a great ally and fighter. But after a tense Oval Office meeting in late February during which Zelensky snapped at Vance, Graham suggested he should resign. “I don’t know if we could ever do business with Zelensky again,” he said outside the White House.\nMark Salter, McCain’s former speechwriter, said he was “disappointed” in Graham’s new tone on Ukraine. Graham was spouting nonsense he did not believe as “Trump fluffery,” he said.\n“People do what they have to do with Trump, but Lindsey’s reputation was built on his foreign policy views,” Salter said.\n“The idea that foreign leaders have respect for Trump’s strength is laughable,” he added. “He’s destroying the world order that people like John McCain and, once upon a time, Lindsey Graham … built and resulted in the United States being one of the most powerful and wealthy countries on Earth.”\nBut Graham quickly embraced Zelensky anew and spearheaded a bipartisan effort to impose sanctions on Russia if  it does not negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine. In the Senate, national-security-minded members still see Graham as someone who can advocate for their causes with the administration, which has rapidly dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development and fired top military brass.\n“I think he’s a bridge between the Trump administration and a more sane and rational view of American self-interest,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut). “Lindsey Graham is very much in what I would call a John McCain view of the world.”\nSo some were surprised and dismayed when he rebuked Zelensky after the meeting.\n“That really didn’t fit with what I expected from Senator Graham,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Delaware), who has worked with Graham on foreign policy issues. “But I think when push comes to shove, he is aligned with President Trump — he is aligned with the direction Trump’s foreign policy is going.”\nBut Coons added that Graham still appears to be working “tirelessly” to get a good outcome for Ukraine.\nDuring a congressional trip by lawmakers to a security conference in Munich in February, Graham was pushing European allies to beef up their defenses to contribute more to NATO.(The congressional delegation still calls itself “CODEL McCain.”)Graham was also seeking to find a “creative” way to provide a security backstop for Ukraine against Russia in any deal, Coons added.\n“At the core, I think Senator Graham is trying to navigate between strongly supporting President Trump and his agenda and believing in the fight for Ukraine,” he said.\nGraham once candidly admitted that being close to Trump helped himstay “relevant”and that his vocal support had earned him the president’s ear. But it’s less clear if having Trump’s ear will result in any meaningful concessions on foreign policy.\nGraham believeshe has changed Trump’s mind in the past, pointing to the “big fight” he and Trump had when the president wanted to withdraw from Afghanistan in his first term. Later, President Joe Biden withdrew, and the operation’s failures became one of his biggest political liabilities.\n“I think he’s come to realize that getting out of a place doesn’t mean you’re safer,” Graham said. “That pulling out and leaving the problem behind doesn’t mean the problem goes away.”\nOver the years, Graham has expressed alarm about Trump’s push to remove troops in Syria, yank security details fromRepublicans he doesn’t likeand — most recently — try to reach a nuclear deal with Iran. He recently joined Democrats in asking Secretary of State Marco Rubio totestify about cuts to U.S. foreign aidand raised alarm about the department sidestepping Congress, a rare act of GOP oversight of the Trump administration.\nGraham said he’s “worried” about the Iran deal negotiations, which are being led by envoy Steve Witkoff with the goal of preventing the country from developing nuclear weapons.\n“The largest state sponsor of terrorism should not be allowed to enrich,” Graham said, urging a deal that does not allow uranium enrichment. “If you can negotiate that, great. If not, you’re going to have to neutralize the program the best you can the other way.”\nWhen it comes to a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, however, Grahamshows more flexibility.\n“I don’t mind trying to end the war in Ukraine; I want it to end, and I don’t mind being realistic,” Graham said. “You’re not going to kick every Russian soldier out, but you don’t want to entice China to take Taiwan.”\nAn idea that Graham floated in February — to automatically make Ukraine a member of NATO if Russia ever invades again — appears nowhere close to becoming reality, as NATO membership appears to be entirely off the table in the latest peace proposal, which Ukraine has rejected.\nDespite his genuine closeness with Trump, Graham faces deep skepticism from some of the president’s supporters in his state, who booed him at Trump rallies around the state.\nOne voter at the town hall, Bruni Baker, said Graham is “kind of a RINO,” short for Republican in Name Only. “I have written him letters when I’m really pissed at him,” she added.\nGraham’s rocky relationship with some Republicans in the state dates to Graham’s participation in bipartisan groups in the Senate dealing with immigration reform and judicial nominees, and continued as he occasionally sparred with Trump.\nTrump is aware of how suspicious many of his supporters are of Graham after the senator was booed at his rallies, said a longtime Trump adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. But the president has a good relationship with Graham and appreciates his loyalty. Trump hears him out on issues but doesn’t necessarily take his advice, the adviser added.\nIn his endorsement, Trump said Graham “has always been there when I needed him.”\nGraham said he was touched by the endorsement.\n“This is his last term, and I won’t be around forever,” Graham said. “And I’m trying to help him.”\nMark Lynch, a businessman challenging Graham from the right, is hoping to capitalize on the unrest among the base. He’s brushing off the impact of Trump’s nod and recently loaned his own campaign $5 million.\n“Trump’s endorsement of Lindsey Graham means nothing to South Carolina because we all know Lindsey,” Lynch said.\nBut political experts in the state believe Trump’s backing is all but decisive for Graham.\n“The Trump endorsement freezes the field,” said Joel Sawyer, a GOP political consultant in South Carolina.\nScott Huffmon, a political scientist at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina, was confident that Graham would find a way through. The senator, he said, “is the ultimate survivor.”"

We are not discarding any hypothesis, but right now, we just focus on what’s most important: returning electricity to our homes,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchezsaidat a news conference Monday.\nThe stoppage, which occurred about 12:30 p.m. Madrid time, caused chaos across the Iberian Peninsula and showed the vulnerability of Europe’s electrical grid — even on days without extreme weather or spiking demand.\nTrains stopped running. Hospitals canceled surgeries, according to news agencies, and depended on backup generators. Business ground to a halt as machines were unable to process credit card transactions. The outage even suspended several Madrid Open tennis matches, withphotosshowing a court with nonfunctioning scoreboards and darkened stands. Sánchezurgedcitizens to restrict cellphone use and to call emergency dispatchers only “when it is really necessary.”\nBy about 5:30 p.m. Madrid time, Red Eléctrica, the corporation that operates Spain’s electricity grid,saidsome power had been restored across corners of the peninsula, including parts of Catalonia, the Basque Country and Andalusia.About two hours later, the utility providersaidmore than a fifth of the peninsula’s power had been recovered. Full recovery may take up to 10 hours, Red Eléctricatold Spanish news outlets, which means the country’s power could be restored some time late Monday.\n“Causes are being analyzed, and all resources are being dedicated to addressing the issue,” Red Eléctrica said in a statement.\nMore than 50 million people live on the Iberian Peninsula, but authorities did not provide an immediate estimate for the number of people affected by the outage. Portugal’s national grid operatordescribedit as a “massive cut” in electricity supply across the peninsula. Data from Red Eléctrica showed a suddenplunge in electricity demandfrom about 27,000 megawatts to less than 13,000. Levels remained abnormally low two hours later.\nSpain’s Energy Ministry said in a statement that Sara Aagesen, a deputy prime minister, visited the Red Eléctrica control center to “learn about the situation firsthand and monitor the incident.”\n“All necessary measures will be put in place to restore normality as quickly as possible,” the statement said.\nPrime Minister Sánchez also held a meeting at the control center, with Aagesen and several other ministers present, the Spanish newspaperEl País reported, and Spain’s National Security Council called a meeting to address the outage.\nPortugal’s Lusa News Agency said the country’s cybersecurity center had seenno evidence so farthat the blackout stemmed from a cyberattack. Separately, the Reuters news agency quoted unnamed officials as saying a cyberattack had not been ruled out.\nThe Spanish grid also connects with Morocco, France, Andorra and Portugal. Spain and France experienced amajor blackouton July 24, 2021, but it lasted less than an hour.\nPrevious power outages in Europe have been caused by technical problems, lightning strikes and damaged cables. In 2003, Italy faced a huge blackout because a tree was too close to a power line, resulting in aflashover, or a jump of electricity from the line to vegetation.\nAngie Orellana Hernandez contributed to this report."

        "article_text": "The House Rules Committee narrowly approved President Donald Trump’s sprawling tax and immigration package in a late-night vote Wednesday, clearing the path for the full chamber to pass the measure as soon as Thursday morning.\nThe legislation would extend trillions of dollars in tax cuts from Trump’s first-term Tax Cuts and Jobs Act along with advancing new campaign promises — such as no taxes on tips or overtime — and hundreds of billions of dollars in spending on the president’s mass deportation campaign and national defense investments.\nBut passage on the House floor is far from assured. Hard-line conservative budget hawks have lingering concerns over how much the legislation — formally called the One Big Beautiful Bill, in a nod to Trump’s nickname for it — would add to the national debt, which already exceeds $36 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office, lawmakers’ nonpartisan bookkeeper, reported that the measure would add $2.3 trillion in over 10 years.\nBlue-state Republicans have voiced worries that spending cuts in the legislation could slice into social safety net benefits in Medicaid and anti-poverty food assistance.\nBut after Trump summoned budget hawks to the White House for a late-afternoon meeting Wednesday, holdouts began to drop their objections, sending what had become a marathon process on to a glide path.\nTrump’s whipping effort seemed to move the needle. Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Missouri) appeared more open to voting for the bill after attending the White House meeting, in part because “it was amazing” to see Trump, “the maestro or the master of the deal,” in action.\n“The meeting was productive and moved the ball in the right direction. The President reiterated how critical it is for the country to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill as quickly as possible,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.\nAn earlier administration statement Wednesday said failing to approve the legislation would be “the ultimate betrayal.”\nHouse Republicans are trying to beat a self-imposed Memorial Day deadline to ship the bill to the Senate. Once the House passes the bill, it still needs to go to the Senate for what members of both chambers expect will be extensive revisions.\nThe Rules Committee, a necessary stop for most legislation before the floor, debated the measure for nearly 22 hours, in a session starting at 1 a.m. Wednesday.\nTrump had visited the Capitol on Tuesday morning for a conservative pep rally, and House Republicans emerged from the meeting bullish on finalizing the legislation.\nIn the meeting, the president scolded blue-state Republicans seeking a higher cap on state and local tax deductions, and he chided GOP hard-liners not to “f--- around with Medicaid” benefits. A consensus, lawmakers said, appeared in the offing.\nBut lawmakers raced to put their own spin on Trump’s words. To some, the president’s comments about SALT meant refusing to raise the tax deduction, and to others, he meant accepting moderates’ demands.\nTo one group, his remarks about Medicaid meant searching for only egregious abuses, while another handful thought it meant finding “waste” within the program’s DNA.\nThe deal Johnson reached with blue-state Republicans would raise the cap on the amount of state and local taxes filers could offset from their federal tax balances. Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act limited the deduction to $10,000. The deal struck with Johnson would raise the cap to $40,000 beginning in 2025 for taxpayers earning less than $500,000, according to Johnson and two people familiar with the arrangement.\nThe cap and income limit would each increase by 1 percent for 10 years, said the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details from fragile negotiations.\nBut that arrangement frustrated Freedom Caucus members wary of how much it would add to the overall bill’s cost. Some lawmakers from low-tax states also complain that SALT rewards predominantly Democratic states that impose higher taxes.\nAround the same time Johnson notched that agreement, White House tax negotiators and the Freedom Caucus discussed phasing in cuts to the revenue thatsome states use to fund Medicaid as a way to reduce the bill’s overall cost. A White House official told The Washington Post that the administration would not oppose that policy if it could earn enough support to pass the House.\nBut altering these Medicaid “provider taxes” has been a red line for some moderate Republicans who represent districts with high Medicaid enrollment.\n“That’s going to be a nonstarter,” Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R), who represents a swing district in northeast Pennsylvania that relies heavily on Medicaid, said Tuesday. “There is a health-care system inside of my district that is potentially closing two facilities, and it’s something that we can’t have in eastern Pennsylvania, and also have the erosion of care.”\nRepublicans are attempting to pass the new measure through what is known as the budget reconciliation process, which would allow them to bypass a Democratic Senate filibuster. But that maneuver brings its own complicated rules that could still threaten the bill’s path to becoming law.\nThe 2017 tax law “was revolutionary,” Scalise told a crowd of conservative activists Tuesday. “This bill is even more revolutionary.”"

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump pressed South African President Cyril Ramaphosa to protect White Afrikaner farmers from violent attacks in an extraordinary Oval Office confrontation Wednesday in which it fell to others to remind Trump of the nation’s long-standing epidemic of violence against both White and Black people.\nTrump amplified false claims that White Afrikaners have been victims of a genocide, even showing video of crosses and earthen mounds that he said represented more than 1,000 grave sites of murdered farmers. The mounds were in fact part of aprotestagainst the violence, not actual graves.\nTrump also made no mention of South Africa’s violent and discriminatory history of White rule before the end of apartheid.\nRamaphosa stared straight ahead during the exchange, occasionally moving in his seat and looking over at Trump, who wouldn’t make eye contact as a clip played of crowds repeatedly shouting, “Kill the Boers,” a reference to White farmers descended from colonists who built and led the nation’s brutal apartheid regime.\nWhile Ramaphosa and several of his deputies agreed with Trump that curbing violence should be a priority, they also noted that it is a problem across all of South Africa, not just in rural areas and certainly not just against White people. And they rejected Trump’s claim that the government is responsible for the murder of White farmers, a group he has characterized as victims of violence and of discriminatory laws.\nThe remarkable exchange was broadcast live around the world and showcased Trump’s selective, and racially polarizing, view of entrenched challenges in a country that endured nearly half a century of state-sanctioned segregation. The stance also reflected a theme of his second term: that efforts at equity have tilted the world against White people, denying them opportunities in favor of unfairly elevating minorities.\nThe Oval Office meetinghad been billedas a chance to reset the trade relationship between the two countries after Trump’s tariffs, and came as tensions escalated over the president’s interest inAfrikaners. Trump in recent months expelled South Africa’s ambassador to the United States and slashed aid to the country over the issue, which has long been a focus of Elon Musk, a South African-born senior adviser to Trump who was in the room Wednesday.\nAfter watching the video, South Africa’s president asked: “Have they told you where that is? Mr. President? I’d like to know where that is. Because this I’ve never seen.”\n“It’s in South Africa,” Trump responded.\nThe video focuses on Julius Malema, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters, a party that advocates giving White-owned land to Black people. That clip was seized on by Musk, who tweeted in 2023, “They are openly pushing for genocide of white people in South Africa.” Ramaphosa’s African National Congress party, a former liberation movement, distanced itself from the song featured in the clip in 2012 — the same year it expelled Malema from the party.\nThe meeting began with a lighter mood, and Trump warmly greeted Ramaphosa outside the West Wing before they moved into the Oval Office. Still, Trump hinted at potential problems ahead: “He is a man who is certainly, in some circles, really respected. Other circles, a little bit less respected. Like all of us, in all fairness,” he said, making clear that the meeting was coming at Ramaphosa’s request.\nRamaphosa noted in his opening comments that Trump requested that he bring along some South African sporting legends, although Trump seemed disappointed that Ramaphosa didn’t bring Gary Player, the retired South African golfer.\n“I spoke to him,” said Ramaphosa, who also gifted Trump a book on South African golf courses. “He said, ‘Look, I’m getting on in my years.’ But he wishes us luck in this discussion with you.”\nTrump soon turned toward more pointed criticism, and the scene turned into one matched only by the one months agowhen Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskycame to the White House and was criticized by Trump and Vice President JD Vance.\n“We’ve had tremendous complaints about Africa, about other countries, too, from people,” Trump said Wednesday, looking at Ramaphosa next to him. “They say there’s a lot of bad things going on in Africa. And that’s what we’re going to be discussing today.”\nThe U.S. recentlygranted refugee status to White South Africansunder a humanitarian designation meant for people fleeing war or persecution that the Trump administration has suspended for other groups worldwide, andwelcomed roughly 50 Afrikanersto the countrythis month.\nTrump held up news articles in the Oval Office that he suggested were validation of his claims of genocide, but he later said he hadn’t decided whether what is occurring in South Africa should be declared as such.\n“I haven’t made up my mind. I hate to see it from the standpoint of South Africa,” he said. “I’m trying to save lives, no matter where.”\nSouth Africa does not release crime statistics based on race, which makes it difficult to identify killings of White farmers. Official police data shows 12 people were killed on farms between October and December 2024 — a period during which 6,953 people were murdered in the country. South Africa has one of the highest homicide rates in the world, the data shows, and has been plagued by violent crime for decades.\nIn the Oval Office, John Steenhuisen, the minister of agriculture in South Africa, who Ramaphosa pointed out is White, conceded that there are problems that South Africa needs to address when it comes to the safety of farmers.\n“I would say we have a rural safety problem in South Africa,” he said during the tense meeting in the Oval Office. “I don’t think anyone wants to candy-coat that. And it requires a lot of effort to get on top of it.”\nHe said more policing is required, as well as a different strategy to address the problems. “But certainly the majority of South Africans, commercial and smaller farmers really do want to stay in South Africa and make it work,” he added.\nTrump grew irritated during the meeting when a reporter asked about his willingness toaccept a $400 million airplane from Qatar, which he wants to retrofit for use as a new Air Force One.\n“I’m sorry, I don’t have a plane to give you,” Ramaphosa said, triggering some laughter and temporarily breaking the tension.\n“I wish you did,” Trump said. “I would take it.”\nHis focus on White Afrikaners has intensified in recent months after the enactment of a law that allows the country’s government, in rare cases, to expropriate land without compensation. The nation’s leaders have described it as a tool to help unwind the legacy of apartheid, but Trump has said it discriminates against White farmers — a contention the South African government has denied.\nRamaphosa has repeatedly challenged Trump’s portrayal of the country’s treatment of White people, which a 2017 audit found make up 7 percent of the population of South Africa but own three-quarters of the country’s land in an enduring vestige of state-sanctioned segregation.\nWhile Ramaphosa in public comments leading up to the meeting said he hoped to “consolidate good relations between our two countries,”Trump’s criticism complicates efforts to recalibrate the relationship.\nSouth Africa faces economic hurdles connected to Trump’s tariff policies. The U.S. is one of South Africa’s leading trade partners — behind only China. The U.S. imported $14.7 billion worth of goods from the country last year, up 4.9 percent from 2023,according to the U.S. trade representative.\nAs Africa’s largest economy, South Africa has been roiled by global financial uncertainty caused by Trump’s tariffs. Wednesday’s meeting came at a time of low growth and high unemployment in South Africa, which is keen to attract U.S. investment and benefit from a trade pact under the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which expires in September and provides eligible sub-Saharan African countries with duty-free access to U.S. markets.\nBarney Mthombothi, a columnist for the Sunday Times, former editor of the Financial Mail and the Sunday Tribune, and former head of the South African Broadcasting Corp., said before the meeting that many South Africans were wary of it.\n“A lot of people think this is a trap, a setup,” Mthombothi said. “If Trump was interested in [knowing] what was happening in this country, how can he take action and then listen afterward?”\nRefugees seeking asylum in the U.S. without the benefit of a presidential push can languish for years, and some critics have questioned the administration’s decision to welcome Afrikaners as refugees under a humanitarian designation meant to shield people fleeing persecution when it has denied this help to many non-White victims of violence.\n“The whole idea that White South Africans are being oppressed is so scandalous, it’s offensive to Black people who have been oppressed for centuries,” Mthombothi said.\nJust before 3 p.m. Wednesday, Ramaphosa left the White House through the same door he had entered three hours before.\nHe told reporters the meetings had gone “very well” and added that he thought Trump heard him. “Yes he did; it went very well,” he said.\nAmong the last to leave with Ramaphosa were two golfers who had attracted Trump’s attention, Ernie Els and Retief Goosen.\nWroughton reported from Cape Town, South Africa."

        "article_text": "A young Israeli couple was shot dead near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington late Wednesday by a gunman who chanted “Free, free Palestine” after the shooting, according to authorities.\nThe victims were both Israeli Embassy employees. The state of Israel’s X accountidentifiedthem as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim.\nYaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues. They were in the prime of their lives.This evening, a terrorist shot and killed them as they exited an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in DC.The entire embassy staff is heartbroken and devastated by their murder. No words…pic.twitter.com/2HytKDp8Fr\nThe couple were exiting the museum after attending an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee when the gunman opened fire. Both were found unconscious and not breathing at the scene, D.C. police Chief Pamela A. Smith told reporters at a news conference held a few hours after the incident.\nSmith said police believed the shooting was carried out by a single person and that a suspect, identified asElias Rodriguez of Chicago, was in custody.\nRodriguez was observed pacing back and forth outside the museum before the incident, she said. After shooting the couple, he entered the museum, where he was detained by security, she said. Police initially said at the news conference that Rodriguez was 30 years old, but later confirmed he is 31.\nSmith said D.C. police had not received intelligence “with respect to any type of terrorist act or hate crime” when asked whether her department had any indication that such a crime would occur. She added that D.C. police had no previous interaction with Rodriguez. “We don’t see anything in his background that would have put him on our radar at this time.”\nYechiel Leiter, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, was visibly shaken during the news conference and said the male victim had recently purchased a ring with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. “They were a beautiful couple, who came to enjoy an evening in Washington’s cultural center,” he said.\nLeiter added that President Donald Trump had called him to say that his administration would “do everything it can possibly do to fight and end antisemitism.”\nIn a subsequent social media post, Trump said: “These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA.”\nDan Bongino, the deputy director of the FBI,saidon social media that he believed the crime was “an act of targeted violence.” Rodriguez was being interviewed by D.C. police and the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force, he said.\nPolice believe the suspect targeted the event but had not singled out any individual before arriving at the scene, according to a person familiar with the investigation. “He just got whoever came out at that moment,” the person said.\nProminent members of the Jewish community spoke out against the violence.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that his “heart aches for the families of the beloved young man and woman, whose lives were cut short in an instant by a vile antisemitic murderer.” He said he had ordered enhanced security at Israeli diplomatic missions globally.\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog condemned the incident as “a despicable act of hatred, of antisemitism.”\nTed Deutch, chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, said he was “devastated that an unspeakable act of violence took place outside the venue.”\nDanny Danon, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, in a social media postdenouncedthe shooting as “a depraved act of anti-Semitic terrorism.” He said Israel was confident that U.S. authorities would “take strong action against those responsible.”\nThe shooting will be investigated as a possible hate crime, Steven J. Jensen, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office, told reporters.\n“We are actively investigating and working to get more information to share,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem said in a post onsocial media. “Please pray for the families of the victims. We will bring this depraved perpetrator to justice.”\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondisaidshe had visited the scene with the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro,who will be prosecuting the case.\n“All of our federal agencies will work hand in hand” with the D.C. police department, Bondi said at the news conference. “We will follow the facts. We will follow the law, and this defendant … will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”\nLior Soroka and Perry Stein contributed to this report."

        "article_text": "Elon Musk often spoke of the hundreds of millions of dollars he spent on electing Republican candidates as a necessary expenditure to prevent the decline of Western culture and values.\nBut his declaration Tuesday that he had “done enough” political spending — at least for now — was yet another sign that the world’s richest man is shifting away from his strong political advocacy and deep government involvement toreturn to his roleas a tech evangelist for his businesses.\nThat shift has been forecast in Musk’s social media activity on X over the past three months, according to a Washington Post analysis.\nSince he purchased the platform, then called Twitter, in October 2022, Musk has used it asan idea generator and a bully pulpit for his views on MAGA politics, government policy and Donald Trump.\nNow that he has pulled back from his full-time government role, Musk posts about space travel, electric vehicles and artificial intelligence. He rarely mentions Trump.\nThe shift mirrors Musk’s effort to revive the companies he controls, which suffered reputational damage and, in Tesla’s case, steepdeclines in stock price during his polarizing tenure in government.\nIn February, more than half of Musk’s posts and reposts on X were about the U.S. DOGE Service — the controversial cost-cutting initiative he spearheaded — or the federal government and politics more broadly, according to a Post analysis. The analysis used artificial intelligence to categorize the text of Musk’s posts on Xsince the start of the year, excluding replies because they lacked context. About 13 percent of his February posts mentioned Trump by name, nearly double the proportion that named one of his companies.\nSo far in May, the numbers have reversed.\nNow, under20 percent of Musk’s posts are about DOGE or American politics, and more than half are about his other business ventures or technological issues more broadly. Just 3 percent of his posts name Trump, while more than 20 percent name one of his companies.\nIt’s a remarkable shift for the billionaire businessman, who crash-landed in Washington with a mission to dramatically slash the size of the government by sending a band of mainly young tech workers into federal agencies to cut people and programs. DOGE — or the Department of Government Efficiency — has fallen far short of that goal.\nThe strongbacklashagainst Musk from some quarters led him to declare that he wouldstep backthis month from government to focus on Tesla, his electric vehicle company, whose stock fell by 71 percent during the first quarter of this year compared with 2024. On Tuesday, heannouncedthat he plans to do a “lot less” political spending in the future after investing at least $288 million to elect Trump and other GOP candidates in November.\nMusk initially forecast that he could trim$2 trillionin government spending through his work at DOGE, which has been responsible for slashing thousands of jobs. While deeply engaged in government, Musk sometimes posted to X hundreds of times per day, and he often took memes, misinformation or offhand thoughts from X users into his work at DOGE.\nHe posted repeatedly and baselessly throughout the election campaign and during the first months of the administration that Democrats had deliberately brought undocumented people into the country to facilitate them illegally voting in elections. On Feb. 11, Muskposteda Fox News segment with the comment: “They imported voters to stack the election.”\nBut Musk was never planning to be a permanent fixture in Washington. When he announced that he was stepping back from government, he estimated that the savings generated by his team’s work would amount to $160 billion in fiscal 2026, far short of his goal.That tally lacks many specific details.\nMusk has already made the transition digitally. He posts much less about politics and instead extols thesafetyof Tesla vehicles  and the makeup of lithium-ion LFP batteries,posting in Maythat their components are “low cost and extremely common.”\nThat change in focus has given some investors hope that Musk’s return will help rally his companies. Tesla’s stock has risen for nearly a month.\nBut some of the business challenges facing his firms have more to do with Trump’s tariff regime than management inattention, and could be thornier to address. Tesla manufactures its cars primarily from parts assembled abroad.\nMusk’s image has changed, too, from genius Silicon Valley businessman to MAGA provocateur, and it is unclear whether he can — or wants to — change it back, according to analysts and corporate-accountability experts.\n“The brand damage is real. It’s been a dark cloud over Tesla’s stock, and Tesla became a political symbol,” said Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, which has been bullish on Tesla but criticized Musk for what Ives said was his neglect of the company while he was in government. “We think that 5 to 10 percent of that damage could be permanent,” he added.\nOthers were more critical.\n“His 100 days have been a failure as his stated objective. And they came at a huge cost to his companies and reputation,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professorat the Yale School of Management. “The negative blowback he’s getting for embracing the Trump agenda is confounding to him, because he had cast himself as a heroic figure in Silicon Valley. Instead of being renowned, he’s become infamous and vilified in many sectors.”\nTesla essentially became a meme stock in the U.S., meaning that its valuation is based more on emotion and sentiment than underlying business performance, Sonnenfeld said. At the same time, Tesla’s overseas sales have suffered steep declines.\nIn turn, when he said he would spend less time in Washington and return to his business empire, Musk left a leadership vacuum at DOGE, with no other figure involved in the effort having the same online clout as Musk, nor as close a relationship to Trump.\nOn his way out of Washington, Musk acknowledged that the time he spent at DOGE came with some personal cost.\nHe has said that his experience in the government was fun about 60 or 70 percent of the time, but he added that he does not like to see peopleprotestinghis moves at DOGE by burning Tesla vehicles.\nMusk’s return to his role as CEO of Tesla, SpaceX and his other holdings has assuaged some previously skittish investors. Shares of Tesla have risen since the company announced its earnings in late April. However, that rally follows months of faltering stock performance as demand for Musk’s electric car brand declined and analysts and investors steered away from the company.\n“It gives investors some hope that he’s focusing on the companies again,” said Yale’s Sonnenfeld."

Police are looking for “likely perpetrators” after an “direct attack” in the Moderna neighborhood of Mexico City’s Benito Juárez district, according to an official statement from the city.\nThe slayings comes after a long string of killings of local politicians after a year of heightened political violence.\nMexico City’s mayor, Clara Brugada, took office in October. Those killed Tuesday were her personal secretary, Ximena Guzmán, and adviser José Muñoz, according to a statement from the city.\nEarlier this month, a local mayoral candidate in the ruling Morena party, Yesenia Lara Gutiérrez, was shot at a campaign parade in her municipality of Texistepec.\nLast year’s campaign season in Mexico wasamong the most deadlyin the country’s modern history, with more than two dozen candidates killed leading up to the June general vote. As armed groups aimed to install friendly leaders in local officers through intimidation and assassination, hundreds dropped out of the race and hundreds more requested security protection.\nIn the 2018 general election, more than 36 local candidates, as well as dozens of other campaign officials and politicians, werekilled.\nMe siento profundamente triste por la pérdida de Ximena y de Pepe.

Sheinbaum later addressed the reporters to say information about the attack had just been confirmed.\nShe denounced the killings and expressed solidarity with the grieving families. “We know them, we stand with their families, with Clara [Brugada], and we will give her all the support she needs from the Mexican government,” Sheinbaum said.\nSheinbaum was the mayor of Mexico City before she was elected president last year.\nShe said that investigators were analyzing video surveillance footage and that the likely suspects were traveling by motorcycle.\nBrugada appeared visibly shaken as she held anews briefingon the deadly attack on her aides. Officials observed a moment of silence.\n“With them, I shared many years of aspirations and struggles to transform first Iztapalapa and now our great city,” the mayor said, referencing a borough of Mexico City that she formerly led.\n“Ximena was a wonderful woman, tireless, truly kind. I knew Pepe almost since he was a child, one of the most intelligent and responsible people I have ever met.

        "article_text": "It’s hard to believe, but nearly 10 years have passed since Donald Trump descended that golden escalator in Trump Tower and, in less than two minutes, placed Mexicans squarely in his rhetorical crosshairs.\nSince then, Trump’s anti-immigrant demagoguery has paid off politically. The rallying cry to build a border wall helped propel Trump to the presidency in 2016, and the portrayal of immigrant communities as the product of an invading enemy played a key role in his return to power.\nEven more troubling, many of Trump’s punitive immigration proposals continue to enjoysubstantial support. Even among Hispanic voters, there has beensignificant backingfor a radical hardening of U.S. immigration policy, although recent images of human suffering caused by deportations have begun totemper that support.\nFor those of us who have spent years affirming the essential role of immigrant communities in the United States, these have been painful times. The rise of nativism as a successful electoral strategy has posed a formidable challenge. How many times must we repeat that the evidence consistently shows immigrants to beoverwhelmingly peacefuland productive members of society, whose main goal is to build a better life in a country they are grateful for — and one in which they feel they truly belong?\nAt times, it feels like plowing the sea.\nIn that struggle, an unexpected — and hopefully transformational — ally has emerged: Pope Leo XIV.\nThe U.S. press quickly labeled Leo the first “American pope,” owing to his U.S. birth. But what makes Robert Prevost truly remarkable is not how his life began but how he haschosen to live it.\nHe is the first modern immigrant pope. And he has wasted no time affirming that identity.\n“My own story is that of a citizen, the descendant of immigrants, who in turn chose to emigrate,” Leo said last week in his firstaddress to world diplomats. “All of us, in the course of our lives, can find ourselves healthy or sick, employed or unemployed, living in our native land or in a foreign country, yet our dignity always remains unchanged: it is the dignity of a creature willed and loved by God.”\nUnlike the millions who have migrated from south to north, Prevost took the opposite path: leaving Chicago in the 1980s to live in Peru as an Augustinian missionary. His path took him back to his hometown for a spell in the 2000s, but in Peru he served as prior, apostolic administrator and bishop. It was this time in Peru that seems to have “shaped” his ministry. “I believe his time in Peru was a beautiful and formative experience,” Archbishop Paolo Rocco Gualtieri, apostolic nuncio to Peru,recently said. It is no coincidence that when heintroducedhimself to the world, he spoke not in English but in Spanish.\nHis family background is equally significant. He is a child of the American melting pot, with French, Spanish, Italian, and — according to his family —Afro-Caribbean and Creole ancestryon his mother’s side. He was raised in a Catholic household in Chicago, a city shaped by successive waves of immigration. His family story is not one of nativism but of the best pluralistic traditions of the United States.\nThat identity makes him a timely symbol. In an era marked by the rise of nativism, racism and contempt for migrants — encouraged at the highest levels of power by such figures as Trump — the election of a pope who has consistently defended the dignity of migrants is no small matter.\nI am not a particularly religious man, but moral authority is real. In 1978, the cardinals who elected Karol Wojtyła — John Paul II — might have sensed that the young Polish prelate would become a decisive actor in the defining struggle of his time: the fight for freedom and democracy. And so he was — the fall of communism cannot be understood without John Paul II. Today, Leo XIV — both a product and practitioner of America’s commitment to diversity — could become a powerful voice against the emerging authoritarianism and new forms of exclusion that are thriving in the contemporary world.\nA counterweight to hatred. That sounds like a mission for our time."

        "article_text": "A Georgia teen detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after police mistakenly charged her with traffic violations will be released on bond as her deportation proceedings begin, a judge ruled Wednesday, in a case that underscores the breadth of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\nXimena Arias Cristobal, 19, will be freed on a bond of $1,500 — the minimum amount allowable by law, said Dustin Baxter, an attorney representing the teenager. He said he expected her to be home by Thursday afternoon.\n“That Ximena was in ICE custody following an arrest that never should have happened is salt in the wound,” Baxter added in a text message. “That ICE didn’t release Ximena after the criminal charges were rightfully dropped defies common sense.”\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to request for comment Wednesday.\nArias Cristobal, an undocumented college student who has lived in the United States since she was 4, now faces the risk of deportation. Her preliminary hearing may take place next year, Baxter said.\nArias Cristobal was arrested during a traffic stop in early May and charged with making an improper turn and driving without a valid license. Officials in Dalton, Georgia,droppedthe charges a week later, admitting that a police officer had stopped the wrong vehicle. But Arias Cristobal’s attorneys saidICE had already taken her into custody.\nArias Cristobal had no criminal record in the U.S. before the traffic stop, Baxter said. A Washington Post search did not find any criminal charges filed against her in Georgia.\nNews of Arias Cristobal’s traffic stop and subsequent detention drew backlash from immigrant rights advocates who said she was unjustly taken into custody based on crimes she did not commit. She’s among thousands of people who have been detained amid the Trump administration’s effort to orchestrate mass deportations, sometimesskirting due process protectionsand other legal constraints. Many, such as Arias Cristobal, appear to have no criminal records —a departure from ICE’s prioritization of immigrants with criminal records during President Joe Biden’sadministration, according to immigration experts.\nDHS alleged earlier this month that Arias Cristobal and her father, Arias Tovar, had “admitted” to entering the U.S. illegally. Tovar, 43, was previously arrested for speeding and driving without a license, the agency said.\n“The family will be able to return to Mexico together,” DHSwrote on social media.\nArias Cristobal grew up in the U.S. and has two younger siblings who are U.S. citizens, said Charles Kuck, one of the attorneys representing her. He said the teenager was kind, gentle and well-known in her community. She was not eligible for protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, known as DACA, Baxter said.\nOn May 5, a Dalton police officer stopped Arias Cristobal while she was driving a dark gray pickup truck. The officer had seen a black pickup truck make an illegal right turn that day and was trying to find that vehicle, police said.\nBut police said the officer mistakenly stopped Arias Cristobal, instead. She told the officer that she had a driver’s license from Mexico but did not have it with her, according to dashboard cam footage of the stop.\nThe video shows theofficer asking her: “So in the state of Georgia, when you drive without a license, you know what happens?”\nThen he asked, “Have you ever been to jail?”\nArias Cristobal responded that she had not.\n“Well, you’re going,” the officer replied.\nArias Cristobal told the officer that she could not go to jail, the footage shows.\n“I have my finals next week,” she said. “My family really depends on this.”\nThe officer allowed Arias Cristobal to call her mother and explain that she could call the jail in a few hours for information on how to get her daughter released.\nArias Cristobal was taken to a jail operated by the Whitfield County Sheriff’s Office, which is among hundreds of agencies that voluntarily partner with ICE. She was transferred to an ICE facility within 48 hours, before her charges were dismissed, according to Baxter.\nOn May 12, police said they had reviewed the dash-cam video and dismissed the charges against Arias Cristobal.\nChris Crossen, Dalton’s assistant police chief, described the incident as “very regrettable,” adding that the officer was “trying to do his job” by enforcing traffic law.\n“I keep using that same word,” Crossen said at a news conference. “I mean it’s a regrettable situation and a regrettable place that we’ve ended up in.”\nRazzan Nakhlawi contributed to this report."

        "article_text": "More than two dozen tanks, 34 horses, 50 helicopters and thousands of troops — many in period costume from past wars — will be part of the sweeping military celebration in D.C. next month to honor the Army’s 250th birthday, officials said Wednesday, offering new details on the multimillion-dollar event.\nThe festivities for June 14 — which is also President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday — will feature country singers Noah Hicks and Scotty Hasting, Army officials said at a news conference about the specifics of an extravaganza that could cost the Army alone an estimated $25 million to $45 million.\nArmy spokesman Steve Warren said Wednesday that he did not have an estimate for the entire government’s cost.\n“That amount of money is dwarfed by 250 years of service and sacrifice that American soldiers have given this country,” Warren said. “This is an opportunity to really strengthen the connection between America and her Army.”\nEvents are planned across the country and around the globe, officials said. But the occasion is unlikely to engulf a city quite like it will the nation’s capital, where the National Mall will host a day-long festival, fireworks will decorate the skyand thousands of troops traveling to participate will sleep in downtown buildings. Officials estimate 200,000 people — about five times the capacity of Nationals Park — will attend.\nTrump is scheduled to deliver remarks, according toAmerica250. Army officials Wednesday said there is no plan for the Army to officially recognize the president’s birthday during the celebration.\nThe day will culminate with a parade, with troops wearing uniforms representing every U.S. conflict dating back to the Revolutionary War and march about a mile down Constitution Avenue from near the Lincoln Memorial at 23rd Street NW to the Washington Monument at 15th Street NW. For each war,there will be 60 troops in period costume uniforms, followed by 400 troops from that same unit in their regular battle dress.\nThey will be accompanied by 28 M1 Abrams tanks, 28 Bradley fighting vehicles, 28 Strykers and other military equipment. Thirty-four horses, two mules and a dog also will participate in the parade. (The dog’s name was not available at press time.) More than 50 helicopters will participate in a flyover.\nThe parade will be followed by a parachute jump by the Army’s Golden Knights, who will land on the Ellipse near the White House and present the American flag to Trump. Then 250 recruits and soldiers will be enlisted and reenlisted by the president.\nThe celebration’s overlap with Trump’s birthday has stirred ire among some civilians and veterans, especially at a time when his overhaul of the federal government includesslashingthe workforce at the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nWhile the Army’s celebration has been in the works for about two years, Warren said, the parade was introduced this year. He said it grew out of discussions with stakeholders across the government.\n“This was not a directive that I’m aware of,” Warren said. “I don’t know who gets the credit.”\nTrump has long mused about soldiers marching and tanks rolling down the streets of the capital and aircraft roaring overhead. But hebacked offthe idea in 2018 amid pushback from the Army and D.C. officials over exorbitant costs and the damage tanks might cause to roads.\nThe Army is finalizing plans to place large metal plates at key points on the route to better protect streets from the movements of tanks set to roll through. The tanks are also being fitted with new rubber track pads.\n“We’re not expecting damage,” said Col. Jesse Curry, executive officer to the Army’s Chief of Engineers. “If there is any damage, the Army is responsible.”\nWhen asked whether the District can expect to be reimbursed for other expenses such as trash collection, street closures and city police overtime, the Army officials said they didn’t know.\nThe celebration marks theanniversaryof the Continental Congress’s vote to officially create the Continental Army to defend the colonies from the British. In addition to festivities in D.C., officials said there would be fun runs, family festivals and fitness contests at locations from Japan and Korea to Germany and Poland.\n“It’s also national, it’s global and it’s even interstellar,” Warren said, adding that an Army astronaut will dial in from the International Space Station. “That’s how big the party is.”\nApproximately 3,000 service members will be housed in downtown D.C. on unused floors of a General Services Administration building and 2,000 in an Agriculture Department building, The Washington Post previously reported. For breakfast and lunch, troops will be offered individual food rations known in Army parlance as MREs — Meal, Ready-to-Eat. They will be offered a hot meal for dinner plus about $69 per day to cover incidentals and alternative food, Army officials said.\nMost will arrive in D.C. on June 11 and leave June 15, Army officials said Wednesday, revising previous estimates.\nWith less than four weeks to go until the event, participating tanks and heavy vehicles are being loaded onto trains in Texas to travel to Maryland. They will then be trucked into a staging area at D.C.’s West Potomac Park. Some lightweight vehicles will stage at the Pentagon and then cross the Arlington Memorial Bridge to integrate with the parade.\nArmy officials said they are in close communication with the Federal Aviation Administration to coordinate the flyover with activity at nearby Reagan National Airport, just across the Potomac River.\nActivities on the Mall will begin Saturday with a 9:30 a.m. fitness competition among service members. Throughout the day, Army equipment and exhibits with interactive displays, including night vision goggles, will be open to the public. A cannon will fire a ceremonial gun salute on the hour. There will be a “Kids Zone” with climbing walls, face painting and cornhole.\nThe parade will begin at 6 p.m. and last about an hour and a half. Fireworks start at 9:45 p.m. Free tickets for the parade and Mall festivities are available throughAmerica250’s event registration portal.\nAs officials finalize parade plans,protestsare being coordinated, too. Demonstrators from across the country intend to protest Trump “and the War Machine” in D.C. that day, according to a permit application filed this month with the National Park Service. Andy Koch, a Minneapolis-based organizer withFreedom Road Socialist Organizationhelping to plan the protest, said a crowd hopes to rally in Meridian Hill Park in Northwest Washington and then march toward the military parade.\nBeyond Washington,hundredsof rallies and demonstrations are planned across the country, spearheaded byIndivisibleand a coalition of other progressive groups in a movement they have called “NO KINGS Nationwide Day of Defiance.”"

        "article_text": "The NFL lost one of its most prominent, outspoken and charismatic leaders and one of its most eclectic figures Wednesday when the Indianapolis Colts announced the death of the franchise’s longtime owner, Jim Irsay.\nThe Colts said Irsay, 65, died “peacefully in his sleep” Wednesday afternoon. The team did not specify a cause of death.\n“Jim’s dedication and passion for the Indianapolis Colts in addition to his generosity, commitment to the community, and most importantly, his love for his family were unsurpassed,” the Colts said in their statement.\nThe announcement came hours after the NFL’s team owners completed a two-day meeting at a Minneapolis-area hotel. Irsay had been absent from the meeting, just as he had missed other such owners meetings in recent months while struggling with health and mobility issues. But he had remained in touch with people throughout the league and had stayed involved in team and NFL business.\n“We were deeply saddened to learn of Jim Irsay’s passing today,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. “Jim was a friend, and a man deeply committed to his family, the game, the Colts, and the Indianapolis community. He spent his life and career in the National Football League. Starting as a teenager as a Colts’ ballboy, he learned every position in the organization before assuming leadership of the Colts approximately 30 years ago. Jim’s Colts won the Super Bowl, hosted another and built Lucas Oil Stadium.”\nIrsay was an NFL lifer who was named the Colts’ general manager in 1984 under his late father, Robert Irsay, who moved the team from Baltimore to Indianapolis. Jim Irsay took over sole ownership of the franchise in 1997.\n“Some of Jim’s fondest memories came from his youth working training camps in Baltimore and growing relationships with players, coaches, and staff whom he considered his extended family,” the Colts said. “He worked in every department before he was named the youngest general manager in team history. … [He] led the Colts to a long series of division titles and brought the city its first Super Bowl Championship [as owner].”\nThe Colts were among the NFL’s most successful franchises in the early 2000s, with Tony Dungy as their coach and Peyton Manning as their quarterback. They reached the playoffs in seven straight seasons under Dungy and won a Super Bowl title in the 2006 season. Manning became an all-time great in a Colts uniform and established the league’s top rivalry with his New England Patriots counterpart, Tom Brady.\n“I am heartbroken to hear about Jim Irsay’s passing,” Manning wrote on social media. “He was an incredibly generous and passionate owner and I will always be indebted to him for giving me my start in the NFL. His love for the Colts and the city of Indy was unmatched. His impact on the players who played for him will not be forgotten. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and everyone in the Colts community. He will be missed.”\nThe team returned to the Super Bowl in the 2009 season under Dungy’s successor, Jim Caldwell, but lost to the New Orleans Saints. The Colts reached the playoffs in the 2010 season but went 2-14 in 2011 as Manning was sidelined by a neck injury. He moved on to the Denver Broncos.\nThe Colts thought they had their next iconic quarterback when they selected Andrew Luck with the top choice in the 2012 draft. But Luck, after a promising start to his NFL career, struggled with injuries and shockingly retired just before the 2019 season. The Colts have been unable to find consistent success in recent seasons, with a revolving door of starting quarterbacks and a succession of coaches. Irsay drew criticism for naming Jeff Saturday, Manning’s former center who had little coaching experience, the team’s interim coach during the 2022 seasonafter firing Frank Reich.\nIrsay often spoke of his respect for NFL traditions. He was a power broker within the league who served on the NFL’s influential finance committee, which oversaw major transactions such asthe $6.05 billion sale of the Washington Commandersfrom Daniel Snyder to Josh Harris in 2023 and Brady’spurchase of a minority ownership stakein the Las Vegas Raiders last year.\nThe Raiders called Irsay “one of professional football’s most passionate stewards” and said in a statement: “Jim’s love of the Colts and appreciation for the NFL was evident in his tireless efforts to promote and improve the game, and his commitment to the Indianapolis community and generosity in his philanthropic efforts touched countless live.”\nSaid Goodell: “He led with integrity, passion and care for the Colts’ players, coaches and staff, and his courageous work in support of mental health will be a lasting legacy. Outside of football, he was a talented musician and built an extraordinary collection of historical and musical artifacts that he shared with people across the country.”\nAmid investigations into allegations of misconduct in the Commanders’ workplace in 2022, Irsay became the first owner to say publicly that he and his peers should seriously consider removing Snyder from ownership of the team.\n“That’s not what we stand for in the National Football League,”Irsay said in October 2022. “And I think owners have been painted incorrectly a lot of times by various people and under various situations. And that’s not what we’re about. … There’s just a lot of closeness in this league. And I don’t think, some of the things I’ve heard, it doesn’t represent us at all. And I want the American public and the world to know what we’re about as owners.”\nIrsay had varied interests away from football. He was a musician whose band performed concerts before sizable crowds. He was an avid collector who owned rare and expensive guitars and other notable items, reportedly including the manuscript of Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road” and the founding document of Alcoholics Anonymous.\nIrsay, his family and the Colts established the Kicking the Stigma Action Fund to address mental health issues. But Irsay also battled personal demons. He told HBO’s “Real Sports” last year that he had been to rehabilitation at least 15 times and had previously overdosed.\nThe NFLsuspended Irsay for six gamesand fined him $500,000 under its personal conduct policy after he pleaded guilty in 2014 to a misdemeanor count of driving while intoxicated. He acknowledged to a judge that he was under the influence of painkillers when he was arrested near his home in an Indianapolis suburb.\nIrsay was taken to a hospital in December 2023 after reportedlybeing found unresponsiveand breathing abnormally.\nIrsay has three daughters who could be in line to take over ownership of the Colts.\n“Jim’s generosity can be felt all over Indianapolis, the state of Indiana and the country,” the Colts said. “He made philanthropy a daily endeavor. He never hesitated to help countless organizations and individuals live better lives. Music was one of Jim’s passions and the ability to share his band and collection with millions of people across the world brought him tremendous joy. Simply put, he wanted to make the world a better place and that philosophy never wavered. Jim will be deeply missed by his family, the Colts organization, and fans everywhere, but we remain inspired by his caring and unique spirit.”"
