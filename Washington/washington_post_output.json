    "date": "May 21, 2025 at 6:00 a.m. EDT",
    "subheading": "In February, most of Musk’s posts and reposts on X were about DOGE or the U.S. government and politics. So far in May, most are about his business ventures or technological issues.",
    "article": "Elon Musk often spoke of the hundreds of millions of dollars he spent on electing Republican candidates as a necessary expenditure to prevent the decline of Western culture and values.\n\nBut his declaration Tuesday that he had “done enough” political spending — at least for now — was yet another sign that the world’s richest man is shifting away from his strong political advocacy and deep government involvement toreturn to his roleas a tech evangelist for his businesses.\n\nThat shift has been forecast in Musk’s social media activity on X over the past three months, according to a Washington Post analysis.\n\nSince he purchased the platform, then called Twitter, in October 2022, Musk has used it asan idea generator and a bully pulpit for his views on MAGA politics, government policy and Donald Trump.\n\nNow that he has pulled back from his full-time government role, Musk posts about space travel, electric vehicles and artificial intelligence. He rarely mentions Trump.\n\nFollowTrump’s second term\n\nThe shift mirrors Musk’s effort to revive the companies he controls, which suffered reputational damage and, in Tesla’s case, steepdeclines in stock price during his polarizing tenure in government.\n\nIn February, more than half of Musk’s posts and reposts on X were about the U.S. DOGE Service — the controversial cost-cutting initiative he spearheaded — or the federal government and politics more broadly, according to a Post analysis. The analysis used artificial intelligence to categorize the text of Musk’s posts on Xsince the start of the year, excluding replies because they lacked context. About 13 percent of his February posts mentioned Trump by name, nearly double the proportion that named one of his companies.\n\nSo far in May, the numbers have reversed.\n\nNow, under20 percent of Musk’s posts are about DOGE or American politics, and more than half are about his other business ventures or technological issues more broadly. Just 3 percent of his posts name Trump, while more than 20 percent name one of his companies.\n\nIt’s a remarkable shift for the billionaire businessman, who crash-landed in Washington with a mission to dramatically slash the size of the government by sending a band of mainly young tech workers into federal agencies to cut people and programs. DOGE — or the Department of Government Efficiency — has fallen far short of that goal.\n\nThe strongbacklashagainst Musk from some quarters led him to declare that he wouldstep backthis month from government to focus on Tesla, his electric vehicle company, whose stock fell by 71 percent during the first quarter of this year compared with 2024. On Tuesday, heannouncedthat he plans to do a “lot less” political spending in the future after investing at least $288 million to elect Trump and other GOP candidates in November.\n\nMusk initially forecast that he could trim$2 trillionin government spending through his work at DOGE, which has been responsible for slashing thousands of jobs. While deeply engaged in government, Musk sometimes posted to X hundreds of times per day, and he often took memes, misinformation or offhand thoughts from X users into his work at DOGE.\n\nHe posted repeatedly and baselessly throughout the election campaign and during the first months of the administration that Democrats had deliberately brought undocumented people into the country to facilitate them illegally voting in elections. On Feb. 11, Muskposteda Fox News segment with the comment: “They imported voters to stack the election.”\n\nBut Musk was never planning to be a permanent fixture in Washington. When he announced that he was stepping back from government, he estimated that the savings generated by his team’s work would amount to $160 billion in fiscal 2026, far short of his goal.That tally lacks many specific details.\n\nMusk has already made the transition digitally. He posts much less about politics and instead extols thesafetyof Tesla vehicles  and the makeup of lithium-ion LFP batteries,posting in Maythat their components are “low cost and extremely common.”\n\nThat change in focus has given some investors hope that Musk’s return will help rally his companies. Tesla’s stock has risen for nearly a month.\n\nBut some of the business challenges facing his firms have more to do with Trump’s tariff regime than management inattention, and could be thornier to address. Tesla manufactures its cars primarily from parts assembled abroad.\n\nMusk’s image has changed, too, from genius Silicon Valley businessman to MAGA provocateur, and it is unclear whether he can — or wants to — change it back, according to analysts and corporate-accountability experts.\n\n“The brand damage is real. It’s been a dark cloud over Tesla’s stock, and Tesla became a political symbol,” said Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, which has been bullish on Tesla but criticized Musk for what Ives said was his neglect of the company while he was in government. “We think that 5 to 10 percent of that damage could be permanent,” he added.\n\nOthers were more critical.\n\n“His 100 days have been a failure as his stated objective. And they came at a huge cost to his companies and reputation,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professorat the Yale School of Management. “The negative blowback he’s getting for embracing the Trump agenda is confounding to him, because he had cast himself as a heroic figure in Silicon Valley. Instead of being renowned, he’s become infamous and vilified in many sectors.”\n\nTesla essentially became a meme stock in the U.S., meaning that its valuation is based more on emotion and sentiment than underlying business performance, Sonnenfeld said. At the same time, Tesla’s overseas sales have suffered steep declines.\n\nIn turn, when he said he would spend less time in Washington and return to his business empire, Musk left a leadership vacuum at DOGE, with no other figure involved in the effort having the same online clout as Musk, nor as close a relationship to Trump.\n\nOn his way out of Washington, Musk acknowledged that the time he spent at DOGE came with some personal cost.\n\nHe has said that his experience in the government was fun about 60 or 70 percent of the time, but he added that he does not like to see peopleprotestinghis moves at DOGE by burning Tesla vehicles.\n\nMusk’s return to his role as CEO of Tesla, SpaceX and his other holdings has assuaged some previously skittish investors. Shares of Tesla have risen since the company announced its earnings in late April. However, that rally follows months of faltering stock performance as demand for Musk’s electric car brand declined and analysts and investors steered away from the company.\n\n“It gives investors some hope that he’s focusing on the companies again,” said Yale’s Sonnenfeld.",

    "subheading": "Jim Irsay, an NFL lifer and the team’s general manager for more than a decade, took over sole ownership of the franchise in 1997.",
    "article": "The NFL lost one of its most prominent, outspoken and charismatic leaders and one of its most eclectic figures Wednesday when the Indianapolis Colts announced the death of the franchise’s longtime owner, Jim Irsay.\n\nThe Colts said Irsay, 65, died “peacefully in his sleep” Wednesday afternoon. The team did not specify a cause of death.\n\n“Jim’s dedication and passion for the Indianapolis Colts in addition to his generosity, commitment to the community, and most importantly, his love for his family were unsurpassed,” the Colts said in their statement.\n\nThe announcement came hours after the NFL’s team owners completed a two-day meeting at a Minneapolis-area hotel. Irsay had been absent from the meeting, just as he had missed other such owners meetings in recent months while struggling with health and mobility issues. But he had remained in touch with people throughout the league and had stayed involved in team and NFL business.\n\n“We were deeply saddened to learn of Jim Irsay’s passing today,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. “Jim was a friend, and a man deeply committed to his family, the game, the Colts, and the Indianapolis community. He spent his life and career in the National Football League. Starting as a teenager as a Colts’ ballboy, he learned every position in the organization before assuming leadership of the Colts approximately 30 years ago. Jim’s Colts won the Super Bowl, hosted another and built Lucas Oil Stadium.”\n\nThe Sports Moment newsletter\n\nIrsay was an NFL lifer who was named the Colts’ general manager in 1984 under his late father, Robert Irsay, who moved the team from Baltimore to Indianapolis. Jim Irsay took over sole ownership of the franchise in 1997.\n\nFollowSports\n\n“Some of Jim’s fondest memories came from his youth working training camps in Baltimore and growing relationships with players, coaches, and staff whom he considered his extended family,” the Colts said. “He worked in every department before he was named the youngest general manager in team history. … [He] led the Colts to a long series of division titles and brought the city its first Super Bowl Championship [as owner].”\n\nThe Colts were among the NFL’s most successful franchises in the early 2000s, with Tony Dungy as their coach and Peyton Manning as their quarterback. They reached the playoffs in seven straight seasons under Dungy and won a Super Bowl title in the 2006 season. Manning became an all-time great in a Colts uniform and established the league’s top rivalry with his New England Patriots counterpart, Tom Brady.\n\n“I am heartbroken to hear about Jim Irsay’s passing,” Manning wrote on social media. “He was an incredibly generous and passionate owner and I will always be indebted to him for giving me my start in the NFL. His love for the Colts and the city of Indy was unmatched. His impact on the players who played for him will not be forgotten. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and everyone in the Colts community. He will be missed.”\n\nThe team returned to the Super Bowl in the 2009 season under Dungy’s successor, Jim Caldwell, but lost to the New Orleans Saints. The Colts reached the playoffs in the 2010 season but went 2-14 in 2011 as Manning was sidelined by a neck injury. He moved on to the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Colts thought they had their next iconic quarterback when they selected Andrew Luck with the top choice in the 2012 draft. But Luck, after a promising start to his NFL career, struggled with injuries and shockingly retired just before the 2019 season. The Colts have been unable to find consistent success in recent seasons, with a revolving door of starting quarterbacks and a succession of coaches. Irsay drew criticism for naming Jeff Saturday, Manning’s former center who had little coaching experience, the team’s interim coach during the 2022 seasonafter firing Frank Reich.\n\nIrsay often spoke of his respect for NFL traditions. He was a power broker within the league who served on the NFL’s influential finance committee, which oversaw major transactions such asthe $6.05 billion sale of the Washington Commandersfrom Daniel Snyder to Josh Harris in 2023 and Brady’spurchase of a minority ownership stakein the Las Vegas Raiders last year.\n\nThe Raiders called Irsay “one of professional football’s most passionate stewards” and said in a statement: “Jim’s love of the Colts and appreciation for the NFL was evident in his tireless efforts to promote and improve the game, and his commitment to the Indianapolis community and generosity in his philanthropic efforts touched countless live.”\n\nSaid Goodell: “He led with integrity, passion and care for the Colts’ players, coaches and staff, and his courageous work in support of mental health will be a lasting legacy. Outside of football, he was a talented musician and built an extraordinary collection of historical and musical artifacts that he shared with people across the country.”\n\nAmid investigations into allegations of misconduct in the Commanders’ workplace in 2022, Irsay became the first owner to say publicly that he and his peers should seriously consider removing Snyder from ownership of the team.\n\n“That’s not what we stand for in the National Football League,”Irsay said in October 2022. “And I think owners have been painted incorrectly a lot of times by various people and under various situations. And that’s not what we’re about. … There’s just a lot of closeness in this league. And I don’t think, some of the things I’ve heard, it doesn’t represent us at all. And I want the American public and the world to know what we’re about as owners.”\n\nIrsay had varied interests away from football. He was a musician whose band performed concerts before sizable crowds. He was an avid collector who owned rare and expensive guitars and other notable items, reportedly including the manuscript of Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road” and the founding document of Alcoholics Anonymous.\n\nIrsay, his family and the Colts established the Kicking the Stigma Action Fund to address mental health issues. But Irsay also battled personal demons. He told HBO’s “Real Sports” last year that he had been to rehabilitation at least 15 times and had previously overdosed.\n\nThe NFLsuspended Irsay for six gamesand fined him $500,000 under its personal conduct policy after he pleaded guilty in 2014 to a misdemeanor count of driving while intoxicated. He acknowledged to a judge that he was under the influence of painkillers when he was arrested near his home in an Indianapolis suburb.\n\nIrsay was taken to a hospital in December 2023 after reportedlybeing found unresponsiveand breathing abnormally.\n\nIrsay has three daughters who could be in line to take over ownership of the Colts.\n\n“Jim’s generosity can be felt all over Indianapolis, the state of Indiana and the country,” the Colts said. “He made philanthropy a daily endeavor. He never hesitated to help countless organizations and individuals live better lives. Music was one of Jim’s passions and the ability to share his band and collection with millions of people across the world brought him tremendous joy. Simply put, he wanted to make the world a better place and that philosophy never wavered. Jim will be deeply missed by his family, the Colts organization, and fans everywhere, but we remain inspired by his caring and unique spirit.”",
