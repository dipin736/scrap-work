    "article": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump were the main characters on the internet and across Washington day after day. Then the world’s richest man started to fade away.\nOn Truth Social, where Trump is known for sharing his unfiltered thoughts, the president used to mention Musk every few days but now has not posted about him in more than a month. Trump’s fundraising operation has largely ceased sending emails that name-check the Tesla CEO. The billionaire’s name, once a staple of White House briefings, now hardly gets mentioned at all. Even members of Congress have essentially dropped him from their newsletters.\nIt’s a remarkable change for the man who was seemingly everywhere in the early days of the second Trump administration. Musk was in the Oval Office, in Cabinet meetings and on Air Force One. He was at inauguration, then in the House gallery for Trump’s first address to Congress, where Trump praised his hard work. He posed with the president and a row of Teslas on the White House lawn.\n\nBut Musk’s highly visible presence in Washington has ended, a POLITICO analysis found. In Trump’s rapidly evolving second presidency, Musk’s monopoly on political discourse, news coverage and social media seems to have broken — driven in part by how Trump and Republicans have all but stopped talking about him.\n\n“I miss him,” said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.).\nMusk’s shrinking presence could have political benefits for the GOP. Public polling has revealed him to be increasingly unpopular — far more so than Trump. Early last month, Republicans also lost a major Wisconsin judicial race where Musk had become both a major funder and a campaign issue. And in Washington, the cost-slashing efforts of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have continued, but have taken a political back seat to tariffs and the budget fight.\nRepublicans still speak favorably of Musk when asked about him. And they of course want his massive wealth, army of supporters, and online influence machine backing them in future elections. But while Kennedy argued that Musk stepping back won’t “make any difference one way or the other” for the midterms, others are starting to say the best way for the tech CEO to help the party might not be on the campaign trail ahead of 2026.\n“Those polls on favorability basically tell you Elon’s doing a great job when he’s on the inside,” said David McIntosh, CEO of the conservative Club for Growth. “And hopefully he stays a long time to do that, but doesn’t take on this role of a campaign surrogate.”\n\nThat could complicate Democrats’ efforts to use Musk as a political foil. They’ve spent months honing strategies, including in the Wisconsin race, to tie the unpopular billionaire to their Republican opponents in battleground contests across the country.\nBut the Tesla CEO, who has an enormous following on his social media platform X, is unlikely to completely disappear — and Democrats say they can still use him as a boogeyman. Musk has become such a potent villain on the left that Democrats still expect to invoke him ahead of competitive elections this year in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as in next year’s midterms. And while Republicans are less inclined to put him at the forefront, they’re also not fully backing away from him.\n\n“Ultimately, the issue here was never about Elon Musk, it was about Elon Musk-ism,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist. “He wrote their playbook, and it’s not about theoretical blame, it’s about real-world damage that he and Trump have caused that will be litigated all through the midterms.”\nThe Trump administration’s shift away from Musk has been dramatic online. In February and March, Trump posted about the Tesla CEO an average of roughly four times per week; since the beginning of April, the president hasn’t mentioned Musk once on Truth Social.\n\nAsked about Trump’s declining mentions of Musk, and whether the tech CEO was a political liability, the White House didn’t mention Musk directly.\n“The mission of DOGE — to cut waste, fraud, and abuse — will surely continue. DOGE employees who onboarded at their respective agencies will continue to work with President Trump’s cabinet to make our government more efficient,” Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\n\nIt’s not just Trump. The president’s top advisers, as well as official White House accounts, have also largely stopped posting photos and content that mentions Musk.\nTrump is also no longer using Musk’s name to bring in money. In February, his fundraising operation invoked Musk in emails to online supporters on a near-daily basis — a sign that the Tesla CEO was red meat for drumming up donations with the Trump-loving online base. (“I love Elon Musk! The media wants to drive us apart, and it’s not working. He’s great,” read part of one fundraising message, sent February 27.)\nBut mentions of Musk in fundraising appeals abruptly stopped in early March. Since then, Trump has sent only one fundraising message mentioning Musk — a May email touting a “Gulf of America” hat that the Tesla CEO tried on.\nAs Musk’s role in the White House has publicly faded, he’s generating less Google search traffic and getting mentioned in the news less. It’s a far cry from the attention he was receiving as a central political figure on the campaign trail and then as the head of the Trump administration’s efforts to slash the federal government.\n\nSome Republicans have come to see Musk as politically toxic, which Democrats have been trying to leverage. First, there’s the polling: voters tend to view Musk far less favorably than Trump. Compared to a few months ago, the Tesla CEO’s approval rating has dropped across most groups , including independents and voters without college degrees.\n\nPolling from Navigator Research earlier this spring found that DOGE’s work becomes less popular when tied to Musk, and polling from Data for Progress in late April found most voters wanted Musk out of government at the end of his 130-day period as a special employee that’s set to expire at the end of in May — or even sooner.\n“The public supported the effort to end wasteful Washington spending, but they did not support the way that it was done,” said GOP pollster Frank Luntz. “His mission to cut the waste from Washington was certainly helpful, but the language he used wasn’t.”\nSen. Jim Justice (R-W.V.), a top Trump ally, said Musk is a “patriot” and that “he’s really trying to give up his time and do a lot of good.” But he acknowledged that the DOGE chief has ruffled feathers.\n“We got too close to the fence. We mowed too far,” he said. “We just adjust. That’s the process that’s going on.”\nIn Wisconsin, Democrats put Musk at the forefront of the state Supreme Court election in April, aided by the fact that the Tesla CEO was a major donor backing the conservative candidate and showed up to campaign in the state. The race became a referendum on not just the broader Trump administration but on Musk specifically. And Judge Susan Crawford — the liberal candidate who ran an ad accusing Musk of trying to “buy” a seat on the court — won by 10 points in a state Trump had narrowly carried last November.\n“He’s finished, done, gone. He polls terrible. People hate him,” said a GOP operative who was granted anonymity to speak frankly. “He’d go to Wisconsin thinking he can buy people’s votes, wear the cheese hat, act like a 9-year-old. ... It doesn’t work. It’s offensive to people.”\n\nIn addition to potential political concerns, part of Musk’s shift out of the spotlight reflects the rapidly changing issue priorities over the early months of Trump’s presidency. In the first few months, DOGE’s cuts were top of mind. And while those efforts continue, they have also given up some of the spotlight to other Trump initiatives, including his market-rocking tariffs and controversial deportations.\n\nSo while Musk’s public profile has declined, that does not mean he lacks access or influence. Just last week, he was among the tech CEOs to join Trump in Saudi Arabia, shaking hands with the nation’s leaders and speaking at an investment forum .\nAnd DOGE’s aggressive cost-cutting efforts, led by a staff Musk brought in, are expected to continue even after he formally leaves his role as a special government employee. Both Republicans and Democrats also widely expect the tech billionaire, who poured $290 million of his own money into the 2024 elections, to continue to be a major political player.\nThis is a modal window.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nEnd of dialog window.\nThis is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.\nThis is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.\nThis is a modal window.\nThat’s one reason why Democrats say they aren’t fretting. Musk remains a foil for Democrats to highlight, but in the context of Trump and Republicans who have enabled him, said CJ Warnke, spokesperson for House Majority PAC, Democrats’ super PAC for congressional races. The issues that have replaced Musk as a dominating issue in news, such as potential Medicaid cuts and tariffs, are still good for Democrats to run on, he said.\nIn Wisconsin’s Supreme Court race, several ads backing Crawford focused primarily or entirely on Musk, and for a while Democrats would sometimes mention Musk — but not Trump — on social media and in statements.\nThe Tesla CEO is still being regularly name-dropped in Democratic congressional candidates’ announcements from Pennsylvania to Illinois and California , in both safe and swing districts. And of the six Democrats running in New Jersey’s June 10 gubernatorial primary, four have named Musk in TV ads.\nBut recent ads tend to avoid making Musk the main villain. As ads blanket New Jersey in the final weeks of the race, the spots mentioning Musk usually put him side by side with Trump. A few give him glancing mentions or a quick flash on screen — not the main character.",

    "article": "House Speaker Mike Johnson arrives for a House Budget Committee markup of a budget reconciliation bill on Capitol Hill, on May 18, 2025. | Francis Chung/POLITICO\nBy Jennifer Scholtes and Meredith Lee Hill\n05/18/2025 07:20 PM EDT\nUpdated: 05/18/2025 10:56 PM EDT\nLink Copied\nHouse Republicans finally launched their party-line tax and spending package from the Budget Committee late Sunday night, after GOP leaders promised changes to appease fiscal hawks after an embarrassing setback.\nThe vote to approve the measure for floor action follows a weekend of negotiations between House Republican leaders, the White House and the four GOP lawmakers who tanked the same committee vote Friday. Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Sunday night that “minor modifications” were promised to those holdouts.\nJust before the late-night markup, the speaker huddled privately in a room adjacent to the meeting room with the Budget Committee Republicans who previously blocked the megabill from advancing: Reps. Chip Roy of Texas, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia and Ralph Norman of South Carolina.\n\nOnce the markup reconvened, House Budget Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) said that negotiations over changes to the more than 1,100-page bill are ongoing: “Deliberations continue at this very moment, they will continue on into the week and I suspect right up until the time we put this big, beautiful bill on the floor of the House.”\nBut Norman told reporters that Republican leaders put their commitments to the GOP holdouts in writing. Those promises, Norman said, include speeding up enforcement of several policies in the bill, including Medicaid work requirements, nixing green energy tax perks enacted during the Biden administration and revoking Medicaid benefits from undocumented immigrants.\nNorman, Roy, Brecheen and Clyde all ended up voting “present” Sunday, allowing the bill to clear committee while still expressing continued discontent. In a statement Sunday night, the House Freedom Caucus said that the bill “fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government” and that the group’s members are “determined and committed to working through the remaining obstacles within this bill.”\nHouse Republican leaders still need to publicly detail possible changes and brief the full House GOP Conference — and their concessions could endanger support among moderate Republicans wary of facilitating a faster ramp-up in Medicaid work requirements and a swifter ending to the green energy tax perks enacted during the Biden administration.\n\nJohnson is planning to meet with the Main Street Caucus on Monday evening. The business-friendly faction includes a group of moderates who requested an audience with the speaker last week to discuss their concerns about Medicaid, SNAP food aid, federal employee pensions and other provisions in the bill they want tweaked before it goes to the Rules Committee and the House floor.\nThe speaker still hopes to meet his target of passing the megabill by Memorial Day, as GOP leaders in both chambers race to enact President Donald Trump’s boldest campaign promises this summer. Top House Republicans want to put the legislation on the House floor by Thursday, when lawmakers are set to leave for a weeklong recess.\nAnd Republicans are further racing to show progress on the megabill after a trio of brutal economic blows last week — including chaos rippling through the bond market, Moody’s downgrading the U.S. credit rating and Walmart’s announcement it would raise prices amid Trump’s latest tariff regime.\nRepublican leaders, White House officials and some of the conservative holdouts huddled Sunday afternoon and made progress on the hard-liners’ Medicaid work requirement demands. They also discussed moving up an effort to repeal certain clean energy tax credits contained in the Democrats’ 2022 climate law, and which are benefiting red states and districts — a move leadership hadn’t been willing to entertain previously, enraging hard-liners.\nIn those talks, GOP leaders listed a $40,000 state-and-local-tax deduction cap for individuals and $80,000 for married couples filing jointly as one of the items they’re working into the final plans — though they’re still looking for ways to pay for it amid talks with a separate group of centrist holdouts from high-tax blue states.\nOne of the biggest outstanding fights: Hard-liners want to accelerate the timeline for strict Medicaid work requirements for millions of low-income “able-bodied” Americans in the current megabill while removing any waivers for states and further limiting funding to states to help pay for the program.\n\nTrump has been reluctant to approve any moves that can be construed as cutting Medicaid, which many of his own voters in deep red states rely on for health care. GOP leaders have been privately discussing moving up the work requirement start date from 2029 to 2027.\nBut as private talks between holdouts, White House officials and GOP leaders wore on this weekend, one thing became increasingly clear: “In the end, the president is gonna have to weigh in on where he stands on Medicaid,” said one person involved in the weekend talks.\nJohnson’s leadership circle has debated when to ask the White House to invite the various warring groups of House Republicans to the White House so Trump can lean on the remaining rebels. But with a larger group of hard-liners still deeply upset that the bill doesn’t cut enough spending and leaves some of the Biden-era clean energy incentives in place, that strategy comes with its own risks.\n“If I get in a room with the president, I’m going to tell him this isn’t what he asked for,” one House GOP lawmaker said.\nIf House Republican leaders succeed in passage, Republicans in the Senate will then begin working on their own changes in order to build enough GOP support on their side of the Capitol. Republican leaders aim to ultimately clear the package for Trump’s signature in June or July, a tall order given the GOP’s slim margins in both chambers and the magnitude of the legislation.\nBesides fulfilling Trump’s campaign-trail tax promises — including no taxes on tips or overtime — the bill would juice military and border security spending by hundreds of billions of dollars, while extending many of the 2017 tax cuts. To offset those costs, the legislation would shrink federal support for safety-net programs like Medicaid and SNAP food assistance, along with ending green tax incentives Democrats enacted during the Biden administration.\nStill, Congress’ nonpartisan scorekeeper is expected to conclude that the package as a whole would increase the deficit and grow the federal government’s more than $36 trillion national debt.",

    "article": "The credibility of elite universities has fallen far, and not without reason.\nFor decades, admissions offices singled out Asian American applicants for unfairly high admissions standards while pretending to care about fairness and “equity.” Academic journals, blinded by ideology, fell victim to obvious hoax papers on topics such as rape culture in dog parks . Diversity, equity and inclusion statements became mandatory loyalty oaths to progressive causes during faculty hiring. And after the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attacks, many university administrators allowed protesting students to disrupt classes, set up unauthorized encampments and destroy university property .\n\nBut in its conflict with elite universities, the Trump administration’s urge to “move fast and break things,” often without regard for the law, threatens to blow the first real chance for substantive higher education reform in decades.\nLeft-wing intolerance is what made universities incapable of adequately protecting basic principles of free inquiry and tolerating racial preferences for groups perceived as oppressed. But right-wing authoritarianism risks politicizing the university even further — and that would eliminate the prospect of durable, long-lasting change that so many reformers like me are hungry for.\nThe Trump administration’s latest action against Harvard is a perfect case study of the problems with the White House’s approach. Federal officials sent a letter threatening to revoke federal funds unless the university made sweeping changes, like reforming its governance structure and admitting students and faculty based on political views. The administration now says these demands were sent by mistake — even blaming Harvard for taking the letter seriously — but Harvard has now sued the government, pointing out among other complaints that the government did not follow the process set out by Congress for revoking funds due to alleged violations of the Civil Rights Act. If the school wins, which by all accounts they are likely to , the credibility of the administration’s funding leverage over other universities will be permanently damaged.\nBut the letter was only the latest in a series of troubling instances of unnecessary overreach and disregard for the law when dealing with universities.\nThis is a modal window.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nEnd of dialog window.\nThis is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.\nThis is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.\nThis is a modal window.\nIn February, Trump’s interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Edward Martin demanded Georgetown University’s law school eliminate DEI from its curriculum or lose Department of Justice career opportunities for students. Not only was the threat of a hiring boycott legally questionable, but Martin’s demands also clearly infringed on the university’s academic freedom, which is protected by the First Amendment.\nIt’s hard to imagine a more short-sighted and needlessly provocative approach: Such an infringement is unnecessary when countering censorious DEI programs at universities since those programs are administrative rather than academic; it is only the classroom that the government must stay out of. Trump, meanwhile, was forced to pull Martin’s nomination for the post amid lack of Republican support for his confirmation.\nThe administration has also haphazardly frozen research funding to many universities, with stated motivations that range from countering antisemitism to keeping men out of women’s sports . On the one hand, it is clearly justifiable to scrutinize federal grantmaking institutions like the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health for ideologically biased projects such as social justice training for engineers , hiring scientists by race and training high school teachers in social justice math .\nBut the administration’s indiscriminate approach has also halted countless important projects like the use of artificial intelligence to detect early signs of breast cancer. There are simple alternative policy changes that would both curb politically biased research and protect crucial scientific research that benefits the public. For instance, the administration could change the criteria by which future grants are evaluated to avoid funding projects that are political in nature. If researchers or universities are unwilling to comply, the administration could let existing grants expire and decline further renewal.\nSome higher education critics might consider this nitpicking — after all, when the federal government holds the leverage, what does it matter if the changes are implemented with the proper decorum? But they neglect the decentralized nature of universities and the buy-in from faculty required to make long-term changes.\nThe Trump administration’s current approach alienates exactly those influential allies within universities who would help facilitate and maintain long-term changes, forcing them to choose between left-wing intolerance and right-wing authoritarianism.\nIt’s worth remembering that while conservatives were the first to ring the alarm on the excesses, even moderate liberals have since found themselves marginalized as they failed to keep up with the latest progressive ideological demands.\nThese people include trustees, who can set policies like stopping mandatory DEI statements ; donors who can pull funds when universities go severely wrong; and politically moderate professors who can make their own classrooms bastions for open debate. Although we were already heading in a direction of deradicalization , the Trump administration’s actions have put those sympathetic actors in a difficult position.\nTake former Harvard president and Obama appointee Larry Summers, who last year condemned DEI statements as not “ reasonable or appropriate .” But now he believes the Trump administration’s approach with Harvard “will backfire as even those most critical of the university pull together against dictatorial overreach.” Steven Pinker , co-chair of Harvard’s Council on Academic Freedom, is a longtime critic of left-wing attacks on academic freedom and open debate. But Pinker now worries that Trump is “following the playbook of totalitarian dictatorships.”\nEven among university leadership, which has been historically unfriendly to reform, the Trump administration’s approach evokes unnecessary resistance. Consider the case of Columbia University , one of the first universities whose funding was frozen by the administration. Even though Columbia conceded to demands from the administration to ban masks during protests and increase security, its funding still hasn’t been unfrozen. Other schools like Harvard see this and think they are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. Fighting, rather than negotiating , becomes the only option for university leadership.\nThe unpredictable actions of the Trump administration could still chill unwanted activities at universities through sheer intimidation for the remainder of his term. But these “wins” would be illusory. Any appeasement would only last until Democrats are back in charge. Democrats would likely then use legislation to close any future opportunities for the executive branch to leverage funding in the way that the Trump administration is doing now. Many advocates for higher education reform may even support these efforts, especially where it pertains to ensuring stable funding for basic scientific research. Then the current batch of left-wing university administrators would be left with almost complete autonomy. Even the more moderate reformers in higher education will be shut down, and a return to aggressive speech policing and political litmus tests will be all but inevitable.\nIt’s still early enough that the Trump administration can turn the ship around and effectively confront the very real issue of ideological capture in universities. But it needs to do so with precision, respect for the law and a long-term vision. Right now is the time to lay the groundwork. Some of the latest executive orders, such as those on repudiating disparate impact theory and investigating accreditors that violate civil rights law , are an encouraging start and should be followed through with congressional action.\nWhatever the administration tries to pursue, de-escalation needs to be part of this strategy. That means credible commitments to restore funding when expectations are met. Universities need to be given a chance to work with the administration, not backed into a corner where their only option is to circle the wagons and fight back.\nSome will argue that restraint and adherence to the law have been ineffective at holding universities accountable. If reformers were more aggressive and disruptive, maybe they would have achieved tangible changes earlier. But this misdiagnoses the problem. Lack of willpower, not principle, was the problem with past efforts in higher education reform. Although the Trump administration has willpower, the lack of consistent adherence to principles leads to reckless actions. If the goal is restoring, not destroying, universities, we need strategic clarity and consistent application of the law. For instance, just as imposing viewpoints on faculty through mandatory diversity statements are wrong, we shouldn’t impose our own political litmus tests.\nThe path forward doesn’t require abandoning our ideals in order to pursue maximalist tactics. We must wield the tools at our disposal legally and in a way that shows we respect the educational and research missions of universities. If the Trump administration continues to treat power as a blunt instrument — wielded for spectacle rather than strategy — he won’t just lose the fight to reform higher education. He’ll ensure it can’t be won.",

    "article": "New York City mayoral frontrunner Andrew Cuomo continues to dominate the field, despite relatively high negative ratings. | Frank Franklin II/AP\nBy Sally Goldenberg\n05/19/2025 05:00 AM EDT\nLink Copied\nNEW YORK — A recent poll conducted in Park Slope, Brooklyn found the well-educated, politically engaged, liberal voters there bear exceptionally high antipathy for Andrew Cuomo’s frontrunner mayoral bid.\nThose voters, whose local food cooperative once descended into controversy over the origin of hummus, also ranked the decisively non-lefty Cuomo third among nine Democratic mayoral candidates.\nThat dichotomy underscores the essence of the race to replace Mayor Eric Adams: Far more voters have a negative view of the domineering former governor than of any other candidate in the Democratic primary. He’s on track to win anyway.\n\nUber hired California-based David Binder Research in late April to conduct the poll, which POLITICO reviewed in full. It reveals the level of distaste Democratic primary voters have for their former governor, whose candidacy has boosted his return to public life after resigning in scandal in 2021.\nNearly three-quarters of the 400 people surveyed hold a negative view of Cuomo, second only to the incumbent mayor’s 90 percent disapproval rating. Eric Adams, a registered Democrat, is sitting out the primary to run as an independent in the general election.\nThe distaste for Cuomo — unsurprisingly on steroids in lefty Park Slope — is echoed in citywide polls and has motivated his rivals to continue pushing toward the June 24 primary, even when their campaign sprints look more like a collective death march.\nCuomo trounced them all last week in a Marist poll that showed second-place Zohran Mamdani falling far short and no one else coming close. A super PAC backing the ex-governor continues to raise gobs of cash , despite its presumed coordination with his campaign costing him hundreds of thousands of dollars in public matching funds and undermining the argument that he’s the most competent candidate in the field. It seems every week someone who called on him to resign just four years ago is rushing to his side — often in writing, since his campaign appearances are limited .\n\n“Cuomo is a paradox: He is way ahead and winning easily but he has high negatives and is vulnerable to attack,” said New York City-based Democratic consultant Jon Paul Lupo, who is not affiliated with a mayoral campaign. “His opponents are all counting on other candidates to spend money on those attacks. It’s a classic freeloader problem — a rational decision for each campaign to make but collectively spells doom.”\nIt may just be that the only way to defeat Cuomo is not with a who, but a how. The candidates can choose a strategy of cross endorsements to capitalize on ranked-choice voting and unify in their opposition to Cuomo. An 11th-hour partnership between Andrew Yang and Kathryn Garcia in the 2021 mayor’s race catapulted Garcia into a close second place . But such a move would require politicians to buck their tendency toward singular success over collaboration.\nMamdani rebuffed a suggestion by city Comptroller Brad Lander to pool funds for an anti-Cuomo ad. Others reportedly rejected Mamdani’s counterproposal. New York political mainstay Scott Stringer didn’t mention Cuomo in his first TV ad that began airing last week. Even the anti-Cuomo Working Families Party left blank its fifth spot on a hypothetical ranked-choice ballot, choosing no one over a few under-funded candidates.\nThis is a modal window.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nEnd of dialog window.\nThis is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.\nThis is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.\nThis is a modal window.\nAmong Cuomo’s rivals, no one has successfully zeroed in on why he’s so unpopular, or how to chip away at his strengths: Executive experience in a time of uncertainty, universal name recognition when few people are dialed into local politics, a trademark toughness that appeals to Democrats desperate to take on President Donald Trump.\n\nThe candidates’ anti-Cuomo messages have yet to stick, but they are starting to put money behind them in TV ads and ramping them up on the campaign trail. Lander is calling him corrupt — a reference to his nursing home order during Covid and an attorney general’s report finding he sexually harassed women on his gubernatorial staff. Cuomo denies all wrongdoing and is pursuing aggressive legal recourse.\nLander recently dropped three-quarters-of-a-million-dollars on an ad buy calling Cuomo corrupt and trying to out-tough-guy the former governor — a tough task for the bookish comptroller.\nMamdani is criticizing Cuomo’s pro-Trump mega-donors , but the PAC backing him has nowhere near the resources of the one supporting Cuomo. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie and City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams have suggested Black voters should pick a fellow Black candidate from their own neighborhoods over Cuomo, who polls best among African Americans. Stringer has lambasted his record as governor. And they’ve all, in one way or another, implied he’s mounting a comeback for selfish reasons.\nBut Democratic voters have yet to respond to those attacks. In fact, outside the bubble of candidates, consultants and local press, the race sometimes feels like it’s barely begun as many New Yorkers remain overwhelmed by national news.\nCuomo led the first round of last week’s Marist poll with 44 percent of likely primary voters to Mamdani’s 22 percent; the ex-governor won the ranked-choice simulation by the fifth round with 53 percent to Mamdani’s 29 percent. With undecided voters factored into the survey, Cuomo started out with a healthy 37 percent, to Mamdani’s 18 percent.\nMamdani, a democratic socialist state lawmaker, has tapped deeper into the well of far-lefty support than any citywide candidate in recent memory. He’s out-raised, out-polled and out-TikToked his rivals. And he’s beating Lander in his own Park Slope backyard, 30 percent to 24 percent, per Uber’s poll. Cuomo came in third with 19 percent, and no one else broke double digits.\n\nNevertheless, last week’s Marist poll shows what Mamdani’s rivals have long privately whispered — he appears to be hitting his ceiling, and it’s too low to bypass Cuomo. He and his supporters in the Democratic Socialists of America have yet to proactively embrace a ranked-choice strategy.\n“There is a lot of appetite in the organization to educate people about ranked-choice voting and also ensuring that people are filling out their ballot(s) to block Cuomo. I think where it becomes complicated is that we are so committed to Zohran and we’ve been campaigning so hard for him,” DSA’s Michael Whitesides said, following a closed-press forum to discuss the relatively new voting system. “American politics is so used to this first past the post. My guy or no guy.”\nAsked about the campaign’s strategy to defeat Cuomo, a Mamdani spokesperson highlighted his robust door-knocking operation — more than 20,000 volunteers having knocked at least 500,000 doors across the city so far.\n“Coupled with an aggressive paid media plan fueled by millions of dollars in matching funds and a relentless focus on an economic message to address the cost of living crisis — an agenda that poll after poll finds to be overwhelmingly popular — we are confident we can overcome Andrew Cuomo’s MAGA billionaires and win a city working families can afford,” the spokesperson said.\nLander’s team saw hope in Marist’s poll, which found him ending the race in third place with 18 percent, after starting in fourth place at 10 percent.\n“This poll shows Brad is one of two challengers positioned to beat Andrew Cuomo and end the corruption and chaos of Adams-Trump,” campaign manager Alison Hirsh said in a statement. “And it shows that Brad benefits more than any other candidate by ranked-choice voting, because he is the one candidate who can unify all parts of our city.”\n“While Andrew Cuomo has had millions of dollars of potentially illegal ads boosting him on TV through his super PAC, his numbers have failed to improve,” Hirsh added, referring to the Campaign Finance Board’s decision to withhold over $600,000 from Cuomo because of potential coordination with a PAC backing him. Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said the campaign “has operated in full compliance with the campaign finance laws and rules” and is confident Cuomo will receive full public matching funds.\n\nThe conundrum for Lander, of course, is that he’s been suppressed by Mamdani and risks angering the younger lawmaker’s loyal supporters by attacking him on the trail.\nAdrienne Adams’ team was also bullish on the Marist poll, which found her starting the race in third place at 11 percent, even as she has yet to qualify for matching funds that are all but essential to win a citywide race.\n“There’s a clear reason why support for Adrienne has doubled without burning through millions of dollars — New Yorkers finally see a candidate in it for us,” senior advisor Missayr Boker said in a statement.\nA gospel singer who regularly attends church in the high-turnout area of Southeast Queens, Adrienne Adams is hoping to undermine Cuomo’s substantial lead with Black Democrats — a difficult task with low name recognition and inadequate funds. She has been campaigning alongside Attorney General Letitia James and released a digital video Friday showcasing her large family and New York roots. She’s also been saying she is running for the collective good — a thinly veiled attack on Cuomo, whom she’s implying is in the race for personal redemption.\nStringer, who routinely polls in the single digits, has been holding tight to his cash until the end — hoping to make a final push on TV and banking on his high name recognition in his political home base of Manhattan’s Upper West Side, where turnout remains high. Stringer has managed to sidestep any mention of the sexual harassment scandal that ruined his chances in the 2021 mayor’s race — accusations he denies — but he has yet to catch fire with voters or endorsers.\nHe’s hoping to win over the United Federation of Teachers, which seems to like Cuomo, and the New York Post editorial board, which does not, according to someone familiar with the matter who would speak only on the condition of anonymity.\n“This is a concerted effort to go late,” the person said. “He has been confident that we should go late with the ads, be lean and mean. From the get go, he’s had a theory that people tune in late.”\n\nThe theory on Myrie scoring a long-shot victory is putting out a slew of policy proposals his team believes will eventually resonate.\n“New Yorkers are coalescing around Zellnor’s bold vision to deliver 1 million homes, provide Afterschool for All and full-day pre-K and 3-K,” Olivia Lapeyrolerie, his spokesperson, said in a statement. “That’s why he has support from all 51 city council districts and community boards. With matching funds in the bank since March and ads launching earlier this month, Zellnor has the pieces in place to win this race.”\nMyrie entered the race with promise but has yet to crack double digits in the polls.\nCuomo is still considered beatable — but the window is closing, said Democratic strategist Trip Yang, who is not affiliated with any campaign.\n“If they can successfully attack Cuomo’s record, there’s the potential for his numbers to go down,” he said. “However, if the candidates spend most of their time introducing themselves, which is a rational strategy because of their low name ID, the likelihood is Cuomo wins.”\n— Nick Reisman contributed reporting.",

    "article": "A container ship is moored in Elizabeth, New Jersey, on May 12, 2025.   | Matt Rourke/AP\nBy Amanda Friedman\n05/18/2025 03:00 PM EDT\nLink Copied\nSen. Rand Paul attacked the economic logic of President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy on Sunday — and agreed that the policies raise constitutional concerns.\nThe Kentucky Republican said Trump’s sweeping tariffs on foreign trading partners are based on “an economic fallacy” about trade deficits and objected to the president’s move to pursue them without congressional approval during an interview on ABC’s “The Week.”\n“Well, tariffs are taxes, and when you put a tax on a business, it’s always passed through as a cost. So, there will be higher prices,” Paul said, arguing, as he has in the past, that unfettered global trade is enormously beneficial. “The only trade that means anything is the individual who buys something. That’s the only real trade. And that by very definition, if it’s voluntary, is mutually beneficial, or the trade doesn’t occur.”\n\nWhen asked about the legality of Trump’s tariffs, Paul seemingly sided with a constitutional provision citing Congress’s authority over taxation.\n“In the past, the court has allowed these things, but I think it’ll be an interesting thing because most tariffs in our history have been passed by Congress,” he said. “We’ve never had widespread tariffs that have been done by fiat by a president, and I object to that.”\nPaul is one of a few Republicans who hesitated to rally around Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs on foreign trading partners, which the administration rolled out in early April. But Trump ended up backtracking on the high-stakes levies, issuing a 90-day pause on the tariffs for every affected country except China in April.\nHowever, after a series of back-and-forth retaliatory measures, China and the U.S. came to a preliminary deal to significantly lower the levies on each other earlier this month.\nThere are several legal challenges brewing against Trump’s tariffs. A recent lawsuit led by New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James and the top prosecutor of 11 other states asserts that the policies have “upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy.”\nOther plaintiffs include members of the Blackfeet Nation in Montana , the New Civil Liberties Alliance in Florida, the Liberty Justice Center in the U.S. Court of International Trade and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\nCourts have previously upheld the legality of tariffs when they’re based on congressional authority. However, Trump’s decision to impose tariffs by himself has raised legal questions about whether he is exceeding his delegated power.\n“Now, we do have a long history, though, of both parties abdicating their responsibility on tariffs and granting power to Congress, which brings up another constitutional question, can Congress delegate powers given to it under the Constitution to the president?” Paul said.",

The move would be a significant expansion of DOGE’s effort to shrink U.S. federal agencies that are managed by the executive branch. But GAO responded with a letter to the DOGE acting administrator, the former health care and tech executive Amy Gleason, explaining that the office is situated under the legislative branch and works for Congress, not the president.\n“As such, we are not subject to DOGE or Executive Orders,” GAO wrote, according to the bulletin sent to staff Friday.\n\n“We also notified relevant congressional committees and will keep them apprised of any further developments,” the notice to staff states.\nIt continued: “We remain committed to GAO’s important mission of supporting Congress in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities.

    "article": "It’s impossible to know who the next president will be. But one thing can be said with certainty: regardless of their performance in office, there will be an attempt to impeach them.\nThere’s been a vast escalation of impeachment efforts in recent years, turning a once rare gesture into something routine. The latest, notable for how comparatively humdrum it was, came just this week.\n\nWhat little drama accompanied the resolution wasn’t about forcing accountability for a president whom many Democrats think has repeatedly violated the law. Instead, it was whether a backbencher — who is facing a competitive primary and thus has a motive for ginning up the Democratic base — would step on his party’s messaging on other pressing issues by introducing such a measure.\nIn the end, Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.) blinked and decided not to force a vote on his resolution to impeach President Donald Trump, bringing an ignoble end to what was the 13th resolution introduced by House Democrats to remove Trump from office since 2016. (The 14 th came on Friday, introduced by Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) .)\nThis is the second most impeachment resolutions offered against any president. The only president with more? Joe Biden, who faced 17 different resolutions introduced in the House to impeach him in his four years in office.\nIt’s a distinct break from common practice in the post-Watergate era.\nFor all the rhetoric about impeaching Barack Obama, not a single resolution was filed to remove him from office. There were three against George W. Bush, one — albeit a memorable one — against Bill Clinton, two against George H.W. Bush, two against Ronald Reagan and no resolutions offered to impeach Jimmy Carter or Gerald Ford.\nImpeachment’s newfound popularity isn’t just limited to the 31 resolutions filed against Biden and Trump combined since 2016. Three different members of Biden’s cabinet along with Vice President Kamala Harris were the subject of multiple impeachment resolutions by various Republican lawmakers. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was the target of six different proposals to impeach him, the last of which was successful and resulted in the second Senate impeachment trial of a cabinet secretary in American history.\nDemocratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York also introduced two impeachment resolutions to oust Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito from the Supreme Court.\nMost of these resolutions went nowhere and few even received a vote. But their very introduction made clear that the threat of impeachment is in uncharted territory, having shifted from a rare constitutional remedy to an easy gimmick for fundraising and partisan gain.\n“I do think some of it is driven by social media and some of it is real,” said Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who notes “there were impeachments filed against [President George W.] Bush.”\nIn Roy’s view, a real impeachment was the one that led to the brief Senate trial for Mayorkas. “He was literally ignoring his duty to defend the border of the United States and Texas was suffering.”\nMeanwhile, Roy snickered at Thanedar’s effort. “The impeachment language directed at President Trump is political, and there’ll probably be 20 more filed before the end of this Congress,” he said.\nIn fact, Roy’s Democratic colleagues largely agreed with him about Thanedar’s efforts, which came as the Michigan lawmaker faces a contested primary back home and while Democrats have tried to focus their entire party’s messaging apparatus on combating the Republican tax bill. They confronted Thanedar on the House floor, booed him at a party caucus meeting and some members even went so far as to ask a colleague the name of Thanedar’s primary opponent so that they could send campaign donations.\nIt may have marked a new low in the ongoing diminution of the resolution of impeachment, another sign the tool had lost its solemnity and its sting. “The shame of it is that impeachment has lost its ability to be a form of accountability and a check on the president. And it’s been just completely politicized,” said Rep. Daniel Goldman (D-N.Y.), who was elected to Congress in 2022 after rising to national prominence as a lawyer for House Democrats during t he first impeachment of Donald Trump .\nRepublicans argue the Democratic efforts to oust Trump also removed taboos in Congress around the constitutional tool, and helped unleash a retaliatory spate of GOP resolutions once Joe Biden captured the White House. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) didn’t even wait for Biden’s inauguration before fundraising off an effort to impeach him.\nIn 2023, Trump infamously posted on Truth Social his own call for a Biden impeachment, arguing, “They did it to us.”The desire for revenge among the MAGA base made impeachment resolutions lucrative for those politicians wooing small dollar donors. In one instance, it sparked an internal Republican feud between Greene and Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) when they sparred over Boebert launching her own separate impeachment effort, rather than joining Greene’s.\n“It’s purely for fundraising,” griped the Georgia Republican over her colleague’s effort to oust Biden. Of the 17 impeachment resolutions introduced to remove Biden from office, Greene introduced six — including three different attempts to oust the then-president on one day in August 2021.\nAnother factor driving the phenomenon is that, unlike simply introducing a bill, launching an effort to impeach an official still remains rare enough to be worthy of a cable news hit. (Thanedar hasn’t gotten himself booked yet but he has held multiple “impeachment town halls” already in his Michigan district and put up billboards touting his effort as well).\nThe result is that, with the obliteration of cultural norms in Congress that once prevented a spree of impeachment resolutions, it’s now seen as just another legislative — or promotional — tool, rather than a last resort against an official who has committed high crimes and misdemeanors.\nAs Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) said with a shrug, “you gotta live by the rules,” noting that members were allowed to freely introduce impeachment resolutions by the rules of the House.\nRoy’s prediction of 20 more impeachment resolutions against Trump by the end of this Congress seems a bit unlikely —- after all, there are only so many times members can introduce similar resolutions of impeachment.\nBut at a moment when Democratic members of Congress are poised for an onslaught of primary challenges and demands from the base that they do something to stop Trump, impeachment resolutions will prove hard to resist — even if there is no chance of success.",
