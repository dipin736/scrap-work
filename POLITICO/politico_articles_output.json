That’s up from 49 percent of Americans who had a negative perception of Musk in February.\nLittle has changed among those who approve of Musk’s job, which stood at 34 percent two months ago.

He blamed schools for shortchanging civics education and leaving students with little understanding of the structure of U.S. government or the role of the courts.",
