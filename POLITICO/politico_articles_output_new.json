    "article": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth prepares to give a television interview at the White House on March 21. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP\nBy Paul McLeary and Jack Detsch\n04/28/2025 12:43 PM EDT\nUpdated: 04/28/2025 01:28 PM EDT\nLink Copied\nA former top adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described a head office gripped by paranoia and more focused on photo ops than leadership, the latest in a series of brutal accusations about the inner workings of the Pentagon.\nColin Carroll, who was fired this month from his post as chief of staff to the deputy Defense secretary, told the Megyn Kelly podcast that Hegseth was obsessed with the spread of leaks and spent half his time investigating them at the detriment of defense priorities.\n“He was very focused on the leaks, and I think it kind of consumed the team a little bit,” said Carroll, who was terminated amid a leak probe. “If you look at a pie chart of the secretary’s day, at this point, 50 percent of it is probably a leak investigation.”\n\nHis ouster came after a vicious brawl among Hegseth’s top advisers, including Joe Kasper, his former chief of staff. Hegseth’s senior adviser, Dan Caldwell, and deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick were also fired during the leak investigation. Kasper left the department last week.\nThis is a modal window.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nEnd of dialog window.\nThis is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.\nThis is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.\nThis is a modal window.\nCarroll portrayed a secretary intent on maintaining a public image of competence and control. Hegseth’s staff often films his early morning workouts with troops, which Carroll said was partly an attempt to push back against the idea of Hegseth as undisciplined and a heavy drinker — allegations that trailed him during his confirmation hearing and which he denied.\n“In order to combat that image, it’s ‘hey, I’m gonna go work out with the troops,’” Carroll said. ”While that is important — and it’s a thing to do to get out there and helps recruiting and helps morale — if you’re taking a half day trip to the Naval Academy at the same time the budget is due, and we really need some support here … come on, you gotta weigh priorities.”\n\nPentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell pointed to the increased number of troops on the southern border, the bombing campaign against the Houthis in Yemen, and contracts canceled by DOGE as signs of progress. “Secretary Hegseth has delivered more change to the DOD in 100 days than most secretaries have in four years,” he said. While the media “focuses on gossip, we’re focused on results.”\nThe ousted adviser described a “tale of two Pete’s” in Hegseth’s behavior, a straight-talking leader able to convince skeptical Republicans to boost higher defense spending, and a Pentagon chief fixed on “weird details” who could get “very agitated” in internal meetings.\nCarroll said that Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg assured Carroll he would not be ousted, even after the others were suspended. Carroll said he “very much” wants to return to DOD to work with Feinberg.\nHegseth, after losing his office’s most senior advisers, has relied on a smaller group that includes his wife, his personal lawyer and a former junior military aide.\nThe Defense Department on Thursday announced three new Hegseth advisers: the former military aide, Col. Ricky Buria; Justin Fulcher, a tech entrepreneur and DOGE adviser; and Patrick Weaver, who worked on Capitol Hill and the Department of Homeland Security in President Donald Trump’s first term but has no Pentagon experience.\nTrump, in an interview with The Atlantic published Monday , indicated that he’s closely following the issues with Hegseth’s team.\n“He’s gonna get it together,” Trump said. “I had a talk with him, a positive talk, but I had a talk with him.”",

That’s up from 49 percent of Americans who had a negative perception of Musk in February.\nLittle has changed among those who approve of Musk’s job, which stood at 34 percent two months ago. However, the poll finds he is still less popular than Trump, who has a 39 percent approval rating and a 55 percent disapproval rating in the Post’s polling.\n\nSupport for Musk is also down by double digits across nearly all demographics, including independents, adults under 30 and people without college degrees.\nThis is a modal window.\nBeginning of dialog window.

But respondents were almost evenly split when it comes to fraud: 34 percent say it has increased under Trump, 32 percent say it has decreased and 34 percent say it has stayed the same.\nNearly 60 percent of Americans said the president is going too far in his efforts to reduce the size of the federal government through layoffs, while Trump’s plan to shut down the Department of Education remains largely unpopular — 66 percent of Americans are against it. And cuts to federal funding for medical research — a tactic of the Trump administration’s retaliation against U.S. colleges and universities — also doesn’t sit well with most Americans: 21 percent support, while 77 percent oppose.\nThe poll surveyed 2,464 adults between April 18 to 22 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.",

    "article": "Dan Rayfield, Oregon’s rookie attorney general, says he didn’t want to spend his first months in office fighting presidential edicts in court. But along with the consumer protection and law-and-order duties that more typically define his role, the Democrat is now a key combatant in Donald Trump’s trade war, leading a 12-state lawsuit challenging the president’s sweeping tariff regime.\nRayfield, 46, is among the newest in a band of Democratic state attorneys general that’s been strikingly coordinated in challenging and stalling Trump’s avalanche of executive orders slashing federal spending, restricting birthright citizenship, gutting diversity and inclusion programs and much more since Jan. 20.\nThe looming impact of the tariffs in his trade-dependent Pacific Northwest state made taking the lead on the lawsuit an easy call, says Rayfield, who served as speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives before winning the AG post in November.\n\n“Right now, in Canada, they are literally pulling [Oregon] products off of shelves,” he told POLITICO Magazine last week as he attended meetings in New York.\nRayfield has worked closely with Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes in leading the suit, which challenges Trump’s invocation of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, enacted in 1977 and now used for the first time to impose tariffs.\n“It’s an unprecedented misuse of emergency powers,” said Rayfield.\nCalifornia was the first state to file suit over the tariffs last month (perhaps unsurprisingly, given its economic heft and Gov. Gavin Newson’s political profile). But Rayfield’s suit — State of Oregon, et al., v. Trump — is expected to be taken up first, and will likely be cited in the U.S. Court of International Trade this week, where judges will consider a private company’s challenge to the tariffs.\nRayfield talked about his confidence in the merits of his case, how labor unions are supporting his push against the Trump tariffs and his disappointment that big companies aren’t speaking out more publicly about the tariffs — even if they’re opposed to them behind closed doors.\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYou’re leading a 12-state lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s tariffs, and you’re involved in a number of other lawsuits on Trump executive orders as well. Why did you and Oregon choose to lead on the tariff lawsuit?\nThe sweeping nature and impact of those tariffs to every aspect of our daily lives — whether you’re a small business operating in the state of Oregon, whether you are an individual just going to the grocery store — the impact to all of us was immense. And so for me, it was a real easy decision.\nWhen you see the president overstepping his authority in a way that effectively is a $3,800 tax on all Americans — that is something that was very easy to sit there and say, “Okay, working families are struggling, and we need to be there to [hold] the line. And if you want to pass taxes in that way, you just need to do it the right way. You need to do it in Congress.”\nYou’re coordinating closely with a lot of Democratic attorneys general on a number of fronts. How do you decide who takes the lead?\nIt’s one of those things where each case is a little bit different. It might be that one state notices the impact first and really starts moving on it, and then we start spreading feelers out. There are other cases — before Trump took office, we knew the hot topics — and the states kind of raised their hands, and we shared resources, knowing that each state can’t do all of the cases. There’s a partnership that we have.\nThis case specifically was something that our office and myself started researching a couple of months ago to really start looking at the basis for him applying all these sweeping tariffs. Our state was a little bit further ahead along in the research with Arizona, and so we were the two states that ended up taking the lead in this case. And it just made sense, right? We had done a lot of the homework. We were ready. It was something we were passionate about, and we moved forward with it.\n\nIt does feel like Democratic AGs are having an interesting moment here, particularly as Democratic governors take varied approaches to dealing with President Trump. Some are a bit more accommodating, some a bit more in resistance, some a bit of both. How do you view your role in this moment as each state tries to figure out how to navigate Trump?\nWell, each elected office has this unique role, and its unique set of tools. So attorneys general right now are really enforcing the rule of law and making sure that when the president takes actions, that he’s following the Constitution, following the law, and that is our defined role. It’s a very reactive role. Obviously, I would rather have had my first four months be incredibly boring — this is not what you want to be doing with your time. [But] it’s incredibly meaningful.\nI have found the cooperation and coordination among all the Democratic attorneys general incredibly helpful, where we are really partnering together to find the right moments, working together to find the right impacts in each of our communities to be able to challenge these unconstitutional actions. In Congress, they have a different set of tools, right? And early on, attorneys are generally going to be very active, and that will probably shift toward Congress, because a lot of these spending things that we’re fighting in court right now, the president could do if he just passed them in Congress. He’s choosing not to do that. And one can wonder, is he choosing not to do that because he doesn’t think that public support for what he’s doing is there?\nPolling does seem to show right now that the public’s appetite for the president’s trade agenda, for some of the elements of his economic agenda, seems to be weakening. Does that affect conversations that you have with fellow AGs about either the approach or the timing on some of these issues?\nNot really. What I wanted to do was get in now, before prices start going up in the grocery stores, before it really starts to take hold. The economists show it’s like a $3,800 increase for everyday normal households, for everyday goods, in a year. That’s a lot of money that most people cannot afford, at least in a lot of communities where I live. So for me, it was the pocketbook.\n\nAt the same time, we’re doing these hearings across the country — each Democratic attorney general is learning about the impacts that people are seeing on the front lines. In Oregon, I mean, things that you would never expect. A small business that makes bras, that can only get certain products from China — that will 100 percent be passed down to consumers across the United States. We have the nursery industry in Oregon, which is one of the largest this side of the Mississippi. Right now, in Canada, they are literally pulling products off of shelves, and these are 40-year relationships that are being destroyed as a result of this. That’s another unique dynamic. That’s why it really wasn’t polling numbers, it was talking to real people, and it was like, “You’ve got to move on this.”\nWhat’s been the reaction, in terms of either support or pushback, within the business community in Oregon? In California, it’s been mixed. What are you hearing from the business community, and from the labor community?\nStarting from the business community, I’ve heard absolutely nothing but positive comments. Most businesses will tell you, behind the scenes, that this is an absolutely horrible economic policy. There is no rational basis behind what the president is trying to accomplish. Now, in a public space, a lot of these businesses are trying to negotiate — larger businesses are, that is — private deals with the president. So why would they be out publicly trying to effectively harm their negotiations on a national level? So there’s a conflict of interest. And right now, I think it’s a unique moment in our nation where people are scared to speak up about impacts, and that is not a democracy. That, fundamentally, is a problem.\nOn the labor side — and this is how I feel about tariffs — I believe tariffs are a valid economic tool. In the ’90s, when you had the dumping of steel in the United States, manipulating the market, tariffs were an appropriate response to balance the playing field when it comes to trade. Congress thought about all of these things, and they passed certain laws with certain safeguards and sideboards for when the president should implement tariffs. And it’s these safeguards and sideboards that were really meant to protect the economy and only put tariffs in when it was appropriate under those set of circumstances. So when we did our rollout, we had the president of Oregon AFL-CIO at our press conference, sitting there [saying], “You can do tariffs and you should, under some circumstances. But when you do tariffs like this, it actually harms frontline workers.”\nBack to the coordination among AGs for a second. California went first in terms of filing a challenge on the tariffs. Was that a surprise? Was there any discussion of combining efforts with California, which is obviously kind of a behemoth in this regard?\nYou know, internally, I don’t know exactly what the California conversation was. When we were researching tariffs within the state of Oregon, I think, and among many of the states, we were further along in our research and preparation and drafting of a complaint.\nIt sounds to me, and again, I would talk to AG Rob Bonta, who has been nothing but wonderful and transparent about where his state is — it really felt to me that AG Bonta was working on behalf of Gov. [Gavin] Newsom, and so I don’t know if that was an AG Bonta case or whether it was a Gov. Newsom case. We didn’t have conversations about necessarily joining each other. We were roughly on the same timeline, is what it feels like. We wanted to file in the U.S. Court of International Trade, and so that’s where we filed. They filed in California for various reasons.\nHow do you view the Trump administration’s legal arguments, its invoking of emergency power? And how confident are you that the Supreme Court, if it gets to that point, would see it your way?\nI think facts are the strongest thing that support us in this case. I think one of the facts that stands out to me is that no president in the history of IEEPA has ever used it to put in tariffs. That’s pretty impressive. And even President Trump, during his first four years when he wanted to do tariffs, he did it the right way under Title 19. So this is unprecedented. It’s an unprecedented misuse of emergency powers.\nThe emergency that the president says that he wants to right in some circumstances, was this imbalance of trade. Now Congress contemplated that — in fact, they created a specific law under Title 19 for an imbalance of trade. So the question that I think all Americans and all the judges should be looking at is, why, if Congress contemplated it and created a law for that, and there has been an imbalance of trade for decades, A, how is that an emergency? And B, why aren’t you using the statute that Congress intended you to use when they delegated the power to the president?\nThe Trump administration is clearly pushing the envelope. Should Democrats actually be learning a lesson from this, and be taking a page out of this playbook, when there’s a Democratic president again?\nOver the history of the United States, depending on which party is in office, the other side, has always claimed that that president is over-using their executive powers. I mean, we all know that. We’ve all read the articles throughout the years. What’s going on right now is obviously unprecedented in context of the prior presidents, and I think that that is incredibly dangerous. It’s dangerous for a Democratic president to do the same things that are being done right now. It’s dangerous for a Republican president, and that’s why you have attorneys general to be that backstop to say, “Hey, hold on. You can’t do that.”\nI also think that is incredibly important to just recognize that it’s not just attorneys general fighting back right now. While we have filed, you know, 20-plus lawsuits, you have more than 200 lawsuits that have been filed by organizations, individuals, law firms across this country saying no, and some of those cases are coming from incredibly conservative organizations, just like on the tariffs case, and that should cause people to pause: Why are Democratic attorneys general fighting tariffs, as well as some also incredibly conservative organizations that have filed similar lawsuits in our courts?\nJust months ago you were speaker of the House in Oregon. How was that transition to the role of AG?\nIn some ways, they’re very similar, and then in other ways, you have entirely different sets of tools to really effectuate change in your community. As speaker of the House, you have a broad set of responsibilities looking at education, health care, and in a lot of ways right now with my colleagues back in the legislature, they are watching this national context and saying, “What are we going to do with our budget?” We’re waiting for the next revenue forecast. If that crashes, which a lot of people expect it will, that is going to change. As a legislature, you have to adapt and react to a lot of these things going on at the federal end. I’m now in this very different role, more on the front end, trying to protect and partnering with them so that they can do their job.\nI would be remiss to not say there’s also other incredibly important responsibilities that you have at the Oregon Department of Justice, keeping communities and children safe. There is protecting consumers, seniors and working families. Those are things that still have to go on while we’re doing this important work, too. For me, it has felt pretty seamless. And we have amazing people at the Oregon Department of Justice. I wouldn’t be able to do any of this stuff without all the folks on the front lines.\nAs former legislator, how do you view the way that Democrats in Congress are approaching the Trump presidency thus far?\nThat’s a tough question, because I never served in Congress, and that is a very different game than, say, being a speaker and a state legislator. So it’s tough for me to sit there and judge under those circumstances. The way my brain has thought about it is right now a lot of the action is in the courts, in this space. It is going to shift to Congress as the president is unsuccessful in the courts, and I think that is where the pressure is really going to be on. I think there’s some things that they’ve done really well under certain circumstances. As an outsider, there’s probably some things that I might have done differently, but it’s really tough to gauge, as I’ve not served in Congress.\nWhat might you have approached differently?\nGood follow up. As a politician, you don’t want to be critical of people, especially when you’ve never walked a mile in their shoes — that’s what I always try to be cautious about. And that’s why I put the big caveat as an outsider.\nYou know, I think that there has been some pressure that could have happened in the Senate on some of these earlier decisions, that I have wondered why certain outcomes happened the way they did. And there’s been some disappointments. I know my senator, [Democratic] Sen. Ron Wyden, did a wonderful job on a bill to kind of pull back on tariffs and there wasn’t support for that. There’s a little bit of disappointment, and that’s probably more toward the Republican senators in that space.",

    "article": "Chief Justice John Roberts speaks during a lecture to the Georgetown Law School graduating class of 2025, in Washington on May 12. | Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\nBy Josh Gerstein\n05/12/2025 07:39 PM EDT\nLink Copied\nChief Justice John Roberts described the rule of law as “endangered” and warned against “trashing the justices,” but speaking in Washington Monday he didn’t point fingers directly at President Donald Trump or his allies for publicly excoriating judges who’ve ruled against aspects of Trump’s agenda.\n“The notion that rule of law governs is the basic proposition,” Roberts said during an appearance at Georgetown Law. “Certainly as a matter of theory, but also as a matter of practice, we need to stop and reflect every now and then how rare that is, certainly rare throughout history, and rare in the world today.”\nAs many legal experts express grave concern about Trump’s attacks on law firms and with several federal judges advancing inquiries into whether the administration is refusing to comply with court orders, Roberts took a longer-term view Monday. He blamed schools for shortchanging civics education and leaving students with little understanding of the structure of U.S. government or the role of the courts.\n\n“That’s really too bad,” the chief justice told graduating students at the law school. “We’re developing a situation where a whole group of young people is growing up having no real sense about how our system of justice works.”\nRoberts suggested some recent verbal attacks on the justices had gone too far, but he gave no specific examples. “The court has obviously made mistakes throughout its history, and those should be criticized, so long as it is in terms of the decision, really, and not ad hominem against the justices. I just think that doesn’t do any good,” the chief justice said.\nIn March, Roberts responded quickly when Trump called U.S. District Judge James Boasberg “crooked” and urged he be impeached for his rulings related to the administration’s deportation of hundreds of men to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n“Impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” Roberts, an appointee of George W. Bush, said at the time.\nIn a speech earlier this month, Roberts’ most junior colleague — Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Biden appointee — condemned “threats and harassment” that she said amounted to “attacks on our democracy [that] ultimately risk undermining our Constitution and the rule of law.”\n\nRoberts’ public tone since Jackson’s remarks has been notably less dire. At a judicial event in Buffalo last week , he repeated his earlier written statement opposing impeachment of judges over decisions, but passed up the opportunity to elaborate.\nRoberts assured the students Monday that the tense public atmosphere surrounding the judiciary and the fact that the justices “disagree a lot” hasn’t led to the kind of “toxic” personal strife that has permeated the Supreme Court at various times in its history.\n“We have to work together on these things that are difficult. You find a way to get along,” Roberts said. “It’s a long job. If you’re sort of really at each other’s throats with bad feelings and stuff like that, it just — it’s not a good way to function. … We do have to address some very, very difficult things, and we’re the only people who are doing it.”\nFor the second time in a week, Roberts, 70, signaled that he has no plans to step down from the court. As he discussed the recent death of retired Justice David Souter, Roberts recalled his former colleague’s “unconventional” decision to step down in 2009 at age 69 without any known health issues or indication his mind was declining. Roberts said Souter said he wanted to return to New Hampshire and “get back to reading some good books.”\n“There aren’t many people who would have that kind of perspective, including myself — I wouldn’t claim to have that kind of view — but sort of a very good, balanced way of looking at all of it,” the chief justice said.",

    "subheading": "WASHINGTON & POLITICS",

    "article": "Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.) speaks with reporters outside the U.S. Capitol, Nov. 15, 2023. |  Francis Chung/POLITICO\nBy Benjamin Guggenheim and Meredith Lee Hill\n05/13/2025 04:45 AM EDT\nLink Copied\nNew York Republican Rep. Nick LaLota said the GOP’s tax legislation as currently written is “dead on arrival” — and accused his party’s chief tax writer of acting in “bad faith” by proceeding with a proposal for a key tax deduction that didn’t have sufficient buy-in.\n“The bill is dead effectively on the floor,” said LaLota in an interview Monday evening of a sweeping tax package released just hours earlier by leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, in anticipation of a markup Tuesday afternoon.\nLaLota and four other blue state Republicans hailing from New York, California and New Jersey have been pushing hard for a big boost to the $10,000 state and local tax deduction as part of the Republican megabill to enact broad swaths of President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda.\n\nBut of policies currently included in the Ways and Means draft bill that would increase the SALT deduction, LaLota accused committee chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) of acting in “bad faith in presenting a bill that … doesn’t even come close to earning our vote.”\nA Republican spokesperson for the Ways and Means Committee declined to comment.\nThe open criticism of the chair of a powerful committee from a member of the same party spells big trouble for Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP leaders as they race to put President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill” on the House floor next week. Johnson can only lose three Republicans on a party-line vote and still pass the sweeping tax, border and energy legislation.\nThe tax component of that bill released Monday included a tripling of the SALT cap to $30,000 and new income limits for the increased deduction. LaLota and his fellow so-called SALT Republicans think that the proposal is wildly insufficient.\nLaLota pointed to a joint statement issued by him and three other Republican lawmakers rejecting a $30,000 cap last week, saying he was surprised that the committee chair revealed that the draft bill included that same figure, with a $400,000 income limit.\n“The SALT Caucus summarily rejected 30k a few days ago, and yet the chairman presented 30k in the meeting,” said LaLota, adding that the SALT Republicans on the call rebutted the proposal. “I was disappointed that the committee chairman insulted us with fake numbers and fault conclusions.”\n\nFor their part, many members of the Ways and Means committee, including Smith, believe that the SALT deduction unfairly subsidizes high-tax states. Smith has also indicated in recent days that he believes it isn’t up to him to negotiate with the SALT Republicans but rather House GOP leadership. Johnson did take a more active role following the Monday morning call, according to Republicans granted anonymity to share details of private conversations.\nAt the same time, SALT Republicans are also experiencing fissures among themselves, which have exacerbated in the last 24 hours, mainly between the lawmakers who say they will accept an agreement closer to $30,000 and those who are digging in for a much larger increase. The SALT Republicans have also been split on whether they can tolerate an income cap on which taxpayers can claim the increased deduction.\nThe House Ways and Means Committee plans to open debate on the tax portion of the Trump agenda bill Tuesday afternoon. House GOP leadership hopes to resolve the differences over the SALT deduction after the markup and before the legislation heads to the chamber floor.",

    "article": "Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) arrives for a House Judiciary Committee markup on Capitol Hill, April 30, 2025.  | Francis Chung/POLITICO\nBy Ben Johansen\n05/13/2025 07:00 PM EDT\nLink Copied\nFive months ago, the congressional DOGE caucuses were the hottest tickets in town, with many lawmakers in both parties eager to prove they believed the federal government should be reformed.\nThe Senate and House established the caucuses before Inauguration Day. And soon after, Elon Musk and his former DOGE partner, Vivek Ramaswamy were on Capitol Hill , introducing themselves to lawmakers.\nThe first DOGE caucus meetings in the House were packed .\n\nBut the group has not been involved with Musk’s decision-making, according to the House DOGE caucus’ first Democratic member, Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.).\nIn fact, the caucus has fizzled out, he said in a Q&A with POLITICO.\nDemocrats, for their part, have largely withdrawn their support for the idea of DOGE in the wake of the dismissal of thousands of federal employees and the elimination of entire agencies.\nMusk has completed much of his government trimming effort while leaving Congress panicked, and in the dark .\nThis is a modal window.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nEnd of dialog window.\nThis is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.\nThis is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.\nThis is a modal window.\nOne of the DOGE Caucus co-chairs says the caucus is “just getting started.”\n“Congress can enact long-term change, and our 100 committed members and eight specialized working groups are working to codify critical reforms and preparing legislation that will unlock savings for the American people,” Rep. Aaron Bean (R-Fla.) said in a statement.\n\nOur chat with Moskowitz has been edited for length and clarity.\nYou were the first Democrat to join the bipartisan DOGE caucus in Congress. What’s the status of that group?\nThe DOGE caucus is dead. It’s defunct. We haven’t met in months. We only had two total meetings in five months. And we weren’t involved at all in anything [happening at DOGE], which Elon was in charge of. Zero. Zilch. Nada. [Musk] did it all on his own.\nDOGE was a complete failure. Complete failure. Nothing has been made more efficient. Ask the people in Newark [Liberty International Airport, which has suffered delays and cancellations] how efficiency is going.\nWas there an expectation that the DOGE caucus would be involved in DOGE’s decisions?\nYes, that’s what the three congressional chairs of the DOGE caucus [Bean and Reps. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) and Blake Moore (R-Utah)] told us. They told us that they were going to work with us. They told us these things would come through Congress.\nNone of it happened.\nDo you expect DOGE cuts to be approved by Congress?\nThat’s a good question. If [Speaker] Mike Johnson decides he actually wants to be the speaker of the House, he can assert some authority to get this stuff moving.\nBut he hasn’t shown any willingness to do that. He’s just been a pawn of the executive branch.\nYou’re the former head of Florida’s emergency management department. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has publicly said she wants FEMA dismantled. What could that mean?\n\n[Johnson] represents Louisiana. If a Category 4 storm comes into Louisiana this summer, God forbid, with the way FEMA is operating, his state will go bankrupt.\nI’m concerned FEMA won’t be able to function this summer. The president is right that FEMA needs reform. But the elimination of FEMA is absolutely wrong and will devastate red states more than blue states.\nLike this content?

    "headline": "In states, tariffs aren’t yet producing the surge of foreign investment Trump is promising",
    "subheading": "WASHINGTON & POLITICS",
    "date": "May 18, 2025 – 07:00 AM EDT",
    "article": "President Donald Trump talks before signing guest book at the Abrahamic Family House, May 16, 2025, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.  | Alex Brandon/AP\nBy Daniel Desrochers\n05/18/2025 07:00 AM EDT\nLink Copied\nPresident Donald Trump has claimed his surge of new tariffs will produce trillions of dollars of foreign investments in the U.S. economy. But some of the people working to lure those investments to U.S. cities and states say they’re not seeing the investment boom, at least not so far.\nTo the contrary, economic development officials and lawmakers from several states say that the uncertainty fueled by Trump’s on-again, off-again trade wars is keeping many foreign businesses from pouring money into the U.S. market right now. And it signals the uneven impact the tariffs are having on reshoring American manufacturing — Trump’s stated goal for raising rates to the highest levels in a century.\n“One of our contacts described it to me as driving a car in the fog,” Lee Lilley, North Carolina’s Commerce Secretary, said in an interview Tuesday at the Commerce Department’s SelectUSA Summit, an annual conference aimed at promoting foreign investment in the U.S . “You’re driving along, the fog descends, you slow the car down. Depending on how bad the fog is, you might pull the car over and turn on the blinkers. And we feel like we’re in that space a little bit.”\n\nBuffeted by news of companies raising prices as a result of the president’s dramatic tariff increases, the Trump administration has made economic development pledges a centerpiece of its messaging strategy. As businesses across the country fret over the administration’s global trade war, the White House has responded by releasing a running list of billion-dollar commitments from major companies, a sign, the president and his aides argue, that his economic strategy is working by forcing more companies to build their products in the U.S.\n“There’s never been anything like what’s happening right now to the United States, I can tell you. Nothing,” Trump said at a roundtable in the United Arab Emirates, part of a multi-day swing through the Middle East where the president touted a slew of new foreign investments . He claimed that, as a result, the U.S. is headed toward $12 trillion in investments since he took office. “There’s never been anything like it. We’re at a level that no country has seen.”\nThis is a modal window.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nEnd of dialog window.\nThis is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.\nThis is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.\nThis is a modal window.\nThe White House, however, is indiscriminate about what announcements it claims come from “the Trump effect.” Some have been in the works for years before they are announced. Others are in line with what the company would have invested, regardless of the tariffs. Some are inflated, adding previous investments to new pledges.\n\nThe reality for economic developers is more complicated. Officials work for years building relationships that can one day, hopefully, translate into hundreds, or even thousands, of well-paying jobs. They go to conferences, chat up companies and foreign investors, tune-up their workforce development programs at community colleges and attempt to carve out a tax landscape that will help lure business.\n“These are large investments that businesses are making and they’re going to do them thoughtfully and they’re going to take time,” said Barbara Coffee, the director of economic initiatives for the City of Tucson, Arizona. “When they’re doing site searches, just to determine the location, it takes years, two and three years.”\nSome major companies have leaned into Trump’s affinity for splashy investment announcements. Apple announced a $500 billion investment in February, promising to expand facilities across nine states and create a new factory in Texas. But that spending may have already been planned, according to the Wall Street Journal .\nKush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House, said the administration is focused on laying the groundwork for future investment, noting that gross domestic investment spiked by 22 percent in the first quarter of 2025. That, however, was before most of the president’s most dramatic tariff increases took effect.\n“The Trump administration is using a multifaceted and nuanced approach to deliver economic relief for the American people while laying the groundwork for a long-term restoration of American Greatness,” Desai said. “President Trump’s tariffs are driving historic investments into the United States in conjunction with a full suite of supply-side reforms, from deregulation to historic tax cuts.”\nWhile a favorite benchmark for both Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike, economic development pledges are notoriously difficult to pin down. Companies sometimes fail to follow through with the plan, or spread out the investment over a longer period of time depending on economic circumstances. Congress even passed a law in 1995 that encourages businesses to put a disclaimer on news releases about investment decisions, saying that they are subject to change.\n\nThe Trump administration has been so eager to show signs of economic growth that it has celebrated companies that are merely “considering” increasing production in the United States. In April, as the markets were see-sawing after Trump paused his global tariffs, the Trump administration highlighted news articles that French luxury goods giant LVMH was considering expanding its U.S. footprint, that the olive oil company Dcoop was pondering whether to increase U.S. production and that BMW was considering adding shifts to U.S. factories.\nWhile BMW has yet to officially add shifts, other auto manufacturers have highlighted similar moves. Last week, Honda announced that it would move production of its popular CRV from Ontario to the U.S., the latest blow to the Canadian auto manufacturing industry as Trump has a 25 percent tariff on vehicles imported into the U.S.\nBut those announcements may conceal the economic reality. Even as the administration has touted decisions from auto companies like Honda and Stellantis to move production to the U.S., auto manufacturing jobs are down 20.8 percent from 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Auto manufacturing jobs fell 4.7 percent between March and April, when Trump’s 25 percent tariffs on foreign auto imports went into effect.\nOther industries are watching the domestic economic and political climate as well. Despite a $50 billion investment pledge, Roche, a pharmaceutical company, said it was evaluating that pledge after Trump issued an executive order aimed at driving down drug prices.\n“We still intend to invest $50 billion in pharmaceutical R&D and manufacturing and diagnostics in the U.S.,” said Dean Mastrojohn, a spokesperson for Roche. “However, should the EO go into effect, the business reality is that the pharma industry would need to review its expenses, including investments.”\nThe sense of economic uncertainty has unsettled lawmakers from both political parties. While Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) has thus far been unwilling to sign onto legislation to remove Trump’s power to impose tariffs or implement trade deals unilaterally, Johnson said Wednesday at a POLITICO Live event that he’s concerned about how uncertainty surrounding tariffs is affecting businesses in his state.\n\n“What I’m hearing from Wisconsin businesses, manufacturers, the National Association of Manufacturers, The Business Roundtable, is right now investment is on hold,” said Johnson. “Again. I come from the private sector. You want as much certainty and stability” as possible.\nDespite Trump’s fast-changing policies, local economic development officials say businesses continue to express interest in making investments. Officials from several states said in interviews at the SelectUSA Summit that they have plenty of new investment deals in their pipeline, even if they are slower to make a major decision amid the current uncertainty.\n“I would say it hasn’t come to a full stop,” Michelle Grinnell, the senior vice president for market growth and business attraction in Michigan. “Some of those timelines have slowed a little bit, especially projects that are maybe earlier in the process are taking a minute. But projects that have been moving forward and are a little more mature in the process, we’re seeing those continue.”\nStill, investments are projected to slow in 2025, according to industry analysts. The consulting firm Deloitte projected that investments would slow slightly from 3.7 percent 2024, before picking up significantly once the upheaval produced by the administration’s trade and tax policy fades.\nThat’s a hopeful sign for local officials like Lilley, who’s eager to bring more jobs to North Carolina’s growing population.\n“I think the more we can get that certainty back, the more our investors can pencil out the project and decide where it works and when it works and on what timeline,” Lilley said. “Because the capital is clearly there, the demand is really there.”",

Davis would not directly say whether that person was the suspect but said authorities were not searching for a suspect.\n\nDavis also said four people were hurt but provided no additional details on the severity of the injuries. Authorities were also investigating the possibility that the explosion was being livestreamed.\nThe FBI said it was sent investigators, including bomb technicians, to the scene.\nPalm Springs Police Chief Andy Mills said in a statement that the blast “appears to be an intentional act of violence” and several buildings were damaged, some severely.\n“There has been one fatality, the person’s identity is not known,” Mills said.\nThe act was being investigated as a possible car explosion, according to two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss preliminary information from an ongoing investigation.\nOne of the officials told AP that investigators believe the person who died was likely the person who set off the explosion, but they cautioned that the investigation was still in its early stages.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said federal agents were working to learn more, adding, “Let me be clear: the Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America. Violence against a fertility clinic is unforgivable.”\n\nThe FBI’s Los Angeles field office said via the social platform X that “investigators, bomb technicians & an evidence response team” were among assets that were deployed. Investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also assisting.\nThe city of Palm Springs said the explosion happened at 11 a.m. and residents were asked to avoid the area around North Indian Canyon Drive near East Tachevah Drive.\nDr. Maher Abdallah, who runs the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic, confirmed that his facility was damaged. He told AP in a phone interview that all staffers were safe and accounted for. The explosion damaged the practice’s office space, where it conducts consultations with patients, but the IVF lab and the stored embryos were spared.\n“I really have no clue what happened,” Abdallah said. “Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.”\nAerial video showed a burned-out car in a parking lot behind the building that housed the fertility clinic’s office space. The blast caved in the roof and blew a wide debris field across a sidewalk and four lanes of the street on the other side of the structure.\nRhino Williams, 47, said he was chatting with customers at a restaurant he helps manage inside the Skylark Hotel just over a block away when he heard a huge boom. Everything rattled, Williams said, and he sprinted to the scene to see if anyone was in need of help.\nWilliams saw a large dark gray plume of smoke and covered his nose with his shirt as he smelled burning plastic and rubber. He said he saw a building had “blown out” into the street, with bricks and debris scattered everywhere, and he spotted a car’s front axle on fire in the parking lot.\nHe said it was the only car in the lot that he saw. He ran into the building, calling out and peering behind the counter to see if anyone was inside. He did not hear a response and did not see anyone behind the counter.\n\nWilliams then ran around to check on other buildings. Multiple windows of the neighboring liquor store were also blown out, he said. Once he saw authorities arrive, he headed back to the hotel.\nNima Tabrizi, 37, of Santa Monica, said he was inside a cannabis dispensary nearby when he felt a massive explosion.\n“The building just shook, and we go outside and there’s massive cloud smoke,” Tabrizi said. “Crazy explosion. It felt like a bomb went off. ... We went up to the scene, and we saw human remains.”\nPalm Springs is about a two-hour drive east of Los Angeles. Its known for upscale resorts, golf courses and a history of celebrity residents.",

Alvarez/AP\nBy Ali Bianco\n05/17/2025 12:07 PM EDT\nLink Copied\nPresident Donald Trump announced he’ll be speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin — and then with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shortly after — as he looks to broker a deal to end the war in Ukraine.\nNegotiations on the war that Trump promised to end on “Day One” of his term have dragged on over the last four months, with the administration’s patience growing thinner as Russia’s ground operation in Ukraine continues despite global calls for a ceasefire.\nNow, Trump said he’ll be talking with both parties, and other key leaders from NATO, on Monday morning to stop the “bloodbath.”\n\n“HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A PRODUCTIVE DAY, A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE, AND THIS VERY VIOLENT WAR, A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, WILL END,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday .\nTrump added that he’ll also be discussing trade with Putin on the call. Several Republicans including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) have pushed for the president to institute new punitive economic sanctions on Russia for refusing to come to the negotiating table.\nTrump has threatened Russia before — saying he could levy additional sanctions if he believes Putin is stringing him along and won’t make a deal.\n“I will use that if I have to, I would rather not use that,” Trump told Bret Baier on Fox News on Friday.\nTrump vowed earlier this week he will “stay committed” to negotiating peace between Ukraine and Russia , backing an unconditional 30-day ceasefire that European leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron and Zelenskyy were pressuring Russia to accept.\nZelenskyy, along with key NATO leaders and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, traveled on Friday to Turkey for peace talks that Putin was said to attend before sending a representative from the Kremlin. Hours later, a Russian drone strike in northern Ukraine killed nearly a dozen people .\n\nRubio forecasted no “major breakthrough” at the peace talks — which were the first direct conversations between officials from the warring countries since 2022.\n“The only way we’re going to have a breakthrough here is between President Trump and President Putin,” Rubio told reporters in Turkey .\nIn his quest to get a ceasefire deal signed, Trump has lambasted Zelenskyy and criticized Ukraine for not doing more to end the war that Russia started. He and Vice President JD Vance dressed down Zelenskyy during his Oval Office visit in February after calling him a “dictator without elections.” Trump has also stoked fears in Europe regarding his friendship with Putin, leading to concerns that a deal between the two countries could include Russian annexation of key territories in Ukraine.\nTrump remained optimistic this week about the chances of a deal, saying on Fox News that Putin is at the table prepared to talk.\n“I’m tired of having other people go and meet and everything else,” Trump said Friday. “I think I’m the only one that’s going to be able to do that one. And I think we will do it fast, too.”",

    "article": "Demonstrators wave Mexican flags during a protest calling for immigration reform, Feb. 2, 2025, in Los Angeles. Eric Thayer | AP\nBy Kyle Cheney\n05/16/2025 10:38 PM EDT\nLink Copied\nWhen a Guatemalan man sued the Trump administration in March for deporting him to Mexico despite a fear of persecution , immigration officials had a response: The man told them himself he was not afraid to be sent there.\nBut in a late Friday court filing, the administration acknowledged that this claim — a key plank of the government’s response to a high-stakes class action lawsuit — was based on erroneous information.\nImmigrations and Customs Enforcement officials now say they have no record of anyone being told by the man, identified only by the initials O.C.G. in court papers, that he was unafraid of going to Mexico. The error, they say, was attributable to a “software tool” known as ICE’s “ENFORCE alien removal module” that tracks individual deportation cases and allows staff to insert comments.\n\n“Upon further investigation … ICE was unable to identify an officer or officers who asked O.C.G. if he feared a return to Mexico,” said Brian Ortega, assistant field office director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, in a sworn statement to the federal judge overseeing the lawsuit.\nThe mistake may have been costly: The judge overseeing the lawsuit said last month he did not order the administration to facilitate O.C.G.’s immediate return from Mexico in part because of the dispute. Instead, U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy, a Biden appointee based in Massachusetts, ordered expedited fact-finding, which helped unearth the mistake.\nICE’s acknowledgment is the latest in a string of errors that have led judges to fault the administration for attempting to carry out President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign at a breakneck pace — often at the expense of due process .\nIt occurred in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man — accused of gang ties by the administration — who was hurriedly deported to his home country in violation of a court order that found he could be a target for violence by a local gang. It also occurred in the case of Daniel Lozano-Camargo, a Venezuelan man deported to El Salvador in March despite a court-approved settlement requiring the administration to adjudicate his asylum claim first.\nThis is a modal window.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nEnd of dialog window.\nThis is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.\nThis is a modal window. This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.\nThis is a modal window.\nMany of those targeted by Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act — a wartime power the administration has wielded to speed deportations of those the government deems “terrorists” or “gang members — have claimed they were erroneously identified as members of a violent Venezuelan gang. The Supreme Court on Friday blocked Trump from another round of Alien Enemies Act deportations , warning that the administration had failed to provide a meaningful chance for those targeted to contest their designation as gang members.\n\nO.C.G.’s case is part of a separate lawsuit against the administration’s decision to rely on so-called “third countries” for deportation. Under the administration’s policy, if an immigrant’s home country won’t accept them, or they have a legitimate fear of returning, authorities may send them to an alternate country instead.\nHowever, Murphy has blocked such deportations without notice, saying those deported under the “third country” policy must have a similar opportunity to raise challenges and legitimate fears of torture or persecution.\nO.C.G.’s case was one of the original factors in Murphy’s decision. The man said he fled Guatemala in April 2024 to escape persecution. He claims that while crossing through Mexico, he was targeted for being gay, raped and held captive until his sister paid a ransom. He then arrived in the United States.\nIn February 2025, a judge granted him withholding of removal to Guatemala, finding his fear of persecution to be legitimate. But the administration quickly deported him to Mexico without notice, his attorneys said.\nIn his ruling blocking third-country deportations without notice, Murphy referenced the administration’s claim that O.C.G. had told ICE he was unafraid to return to Mexico, but he said he didn’t buy it because it was based on hearsay from Ortega. However, because of the dispute, Murphy declined to immediately order the government to facilitate O.C.G.’s return from Mexico. It’s unclear whether the admission from the Trump administration will alter his thinking.\nThe administration has appealed Murphy’s order to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals, which sided with Murphy on Friday and rejected the government’s effort to quickly lift the block on third-country deportations.",

    "article": "A D.C. Circuit panel handed President Donald Trump an incremental win in a dispute over his effort to strip federal government workers of union representation. | Francis Chung/POLITICO\nBy Josh Gerstein\n05/16/2025 08:39 PM EDT\nLink Copied\nA federal appeals court has lifted a lower-court order that prevented the federal government from implementing President Donald Trump’s plan to end collective bargaining by workers at more than a dozen federal agencies.\nIn a 2-1 ruling Friday, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals said U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman appeared to have erred last month when he froze Trump’s executive order on the subject.\nThe appeals court’s majority said there was insufficient evidence that the National Treasury Employees Union faced “irreparable harm” that would justify the preliminary injunction, Friedman said in his ruling.\n\nJudges Karen Henderson, a George H. W. Bush appointee, and Justin Walker, a Trump appointee, said the national security exception the president invoked in federal labor relations law is an added reason for courts to tread lightly.\n“Preserving the President’s autonomy under a statute that expressly recognizes his national-security expertise is within the public interest,” Henderson and Walker wrote.\nJudge Michelle Childs, a Biden appointee, dissented. She noted that the administration had agreed not to implement the key parts of the executive order as the litigation played out. That undercut the notion that the government needed emergency relief from the appeals court, she said.\n“How can the Government argue that the district court injunction will cause irreparable injury when the Government itself voluntarily imposed that same constraint?” Childs asked.\nThe National Treasury Employees Union said Trump’s order threatened to end the union representation for about 100,000 federal workers, or roughly two-thirds of NTEU’s membership. An NTEU spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nHenderson and Walker also faulted Friedman, a Clinton appointee, for failing to make the union post a financial bond in order to get relief from Trump’s order while the suit progresses. Trump issued a directive in March that the Justice Department urge judges to require such bonds in every case where litigants seek urgent relief from a federal government policy.\nThe appeals court panel’s majority noted Friday that such bonds are “generally required” and added that they “doubt that $0 was the appropriate bond” in the union’s case.",

    "article": "OTTAWA — Pete Hoekstra thumbs through an imaginary document, and pauses for effect: “This is a serious proposal — pile one.” Then he raises a second document. “I can’t believe this,” he guffaws. “This is a joke.” Straight to the discard pile.\nThat, says President Donald Trump’s ambassador to Canada, is how it will go — one way or another — when newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney submits a proposal on a revamped economic and security agreement with the United States.\n“The ball’s in your court,” Hoekstra told POLITICO Magazine in a Thursday sit-down at the U.S. Embassy.\n\nHoekstra, who left his blazer in his upper floor office, casually fended off queries about Trump’s desire to make Canada the 51st state. He peppered his responses with jokes, even as he was deadly serious at other times about the future of the U.S.-Canada relationship and how he sees his role as ambassador.\nA former Michigan GOP congressman, Hoekstra was born in the Netherlands and served as ambassador to his native land during Trump’s first term. He feels at home in the Canadian capital, which recently celebrated the 80-anniversary of the Dutch liberation from Nazi Germany.\nBut he’s also feeling hurt by Canadians’ ban of certain American products from their store shelves in the wake of Trump’s trade war and calls for annexation.\n“That is an insult to us,” he said. “We have not done anything like that.”\nThe previous evening, Hoekstra was seen by a POLITICO colleague holding a 30-minute impromptu meeting with Canada’s finance minister on the sidelines of the opening night reception of the B7, an important subgroup of the G7 summit that Carney is hosting this year.\nThat’s where we started our conversation, edited for length and clarity.\n\nIt appears you had a really interesting conversation last night with Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne? What can you say about that?\nIt’s fake news. I’m just kidding, just kidding. They said, hey, Champagne, would love to meet with you. ... We had a great initial conversation. Obviously, I’ve never met him before. I spent about 30 minutes talking with him.\nAny impression from him on his dedication to that file and the G7 finance ministers next week?\nThis was a meeting to get to know each other. He was very cordial, very friendly, very outgoing. We told him we were going to Quebec City sometime in July. He said, “Oh, you know, make sure that I know, we will get together.”\nWe talked a little bit about some of the issues that are going on, but not into a lot of detail.\nWhen President Trump first announced your nomination for this, did you have any idea you would be coming into a context like this, that it might be this challenging?\nI’ve spent a lot of time doing foreign policy. When I was in Congress and when I was on the Intel Committee, I traveled to 84 different countries. I’ve met with Gaddafi. I’ve met with Assad, Arafat.\nYou’ve been in tight spots before?\nI’m not even sure I would have called them tight spots. Challenging in terms of what the topics were, but also with a recognition that in a lot of those you can get through them relatively quickly. I mean, if you’re in Afghanistan or Iraq, you recognize that you never got through. Because you’ve spent some time in Afghanistan, right?\nOh yeah.\n\nThat’s amazing. I traveled to Afghanistan. I was there five different times. But when a congressional delegation comes in, we parachute in, we’re there for two or three nights, then we’re airlifted out.\nSo you come to Ottawa, where there’s a certain perception of Americans right now. And you get to go to the Tulip Festival and you get to relive some of the heritage of your birthplace. What did you think of all that?\nIt’s great. Here, it is a remembrance and appreciation for what the Canadians did to help liberate the Netherlands. I mean, they liberated my mom and dad, right? So that’s a big deal.\nDoes it make you feel any more connected here in any particular way?\nNot in any particular way other than I know there’s a lot of Dutch here. I know that the Canadians and the Americans, we sacrificed a tremendous amount in the Netherlands for World War Two. I’m sometimes envious of the special relationship that the Canadians have with the Dutch. But we had Operation Market Garden with the Brits and the Poles. We lost a lot of Americans. I think Canadians are envious of the film A Bridge Too Far, which highlights Americans and the Brits and the exploits that they made in the Netherlands.\nCan we talk about the 51st state stuff? In your confirmation hearing, you said you affirm Canada as a sovereign country.\nAnd last I checked, America does not send ambassadors to states.\nGood point. But then your president, of course, restates it in the context of the Oval Office with Prime Minister Mark Carney, and you were there. How does this affect your job and your marching orders? Can you just explain how you reconcile that in your mind?\n\nI thought the president and Carney reconciled it very well. There’s nothing more that I have to say. The president said, “Hey, we love Canada. Yeah, it would be a great deal for you to be the 51st state.” Carney says, “It ain’t gonna happen.” And the president says, “Never say never.”\nI’ve got my marching orders. The president’s laid out the priorities very clearly. We’ve got to do everything to keep America safe, secure and prosperous, right? And if you’re doing your priority list, you know you can put things under those three priorities somewhere, then go do it.\nWhat can you say about what President Trump likes about Prime Minister Carney, as opposed to Justin Trudeau?\nI’ve never watched the dynamics between him and Trudeau. [Trump and Carney are] both successful business people in the business world. Carney is smart. They had a great conversation at lunch, and they could go back and forth through all these different issues. So the president got a smart guy sitting across the table.\nIt’s a good place to be with the president. The president likes to have friends. We all like to have [friends]. But the president’s a business guy. It’s kind of like, okay, “Is this somebody that I can get to a deal with? Can I talk to him about tariffs? Can I talk to him about NATO? Can I talk to him about the Arctic and all of these kinds of things?” So I think the president and his team are very much waiting for the signals from the Carney team, as to exactly what the agenda is going to be.\nWhat’s the top signal you’re looking for? Is it defense? Canada has done a lot of, tried to do a lot on the border, but defense spending? Is that one, or what else?\nThe Canadians focused on 51st state [rhetoric]. But what we’re looking for is: There have been indications that the Canadians are saying, “Okay, we’re going somewhere else. America is no longer…”\nCarney calls them new reliable trading partners. How does that make you feel when he uses that kind of language?\nThat’s Canada’s decision. I don’t like it but that’s Canada’s decision. I prefer them to be a great ally with us on energy. I prefer them to be a great ally with us on the auto industry. I prefer them to be a great ally with us on defense, on the Arctic and all of those kinds of things. And I think that’s where the administration is. But if the Canadians want to go a different path, that their best bet for an economic relationship is to do it with the EU, I don’t think it’s a very advantageous move, but if that’s what they decide to do…\nDoesn’t look like that’ll happen. But we hear the word diversification in Canada endlessly.\n[Hoesktra laughs]\nBut anyway, what about the auto industry? You’re from Michigan. Deep links. Does the president really want to reshore all of that work to the U.S.? You talk about cooperation. Does cooperation entail keeping jobs in Canada?\nThis relationship will be written by the response to the president from the Oval Office meeting.\nWhat is Carney going to come back with? What’s Canada looking for? I was at the White House on Tuesday. I met with [Director of the National Economic Council] Kevin Hassett .\nWe have lots of proposals coming in. Hassett and his team, [Commerce Secretary Howard] Lutnick and these guys, it’s very straightforward.\nThey go through [and Hoekstra eyes an imaginary document] and say, “This is a serious proposal — pile one.” [Hoekstra then holds up another imaginary document] “I can’t believe this. This is a joke.” They basically put that in the circular file.\nHas Canada put anything out there yet that’s gone in either pile?\nNo. Carney’s just announced his Cabinet. You got the speech from the throne in two weeks, which outlines — I think it’s similar to what they do in the Netherlands — that this lays out the agenda.\nWe’ll dissect it and see exactly what signals we get. But the most important thing will be: What’s the proposal that comes back from the Carney government on a path forward? Is it an agenda in a platform that creates the case for giving Canada the best deal of any one, of any country in the world?\nBecause of what we do on energy, what we do on autos, on a whole range of issues? Or is it something else that just says, “Hey, we’re going to diversify. We are now one of 170 countries that America does business with.”\nWhat do you want to see on energy? We’ve got these critical minerals. We’ve got so much other stuff.\nThe president is very interested in critical minerals. He’s very interested in energy. He’s fascinated, and he loves, he loves Michigan, he loves autos. You know what the benchmarks are, and you know that he cares about 2 percent [defense spending target under NATO]. He cares deeply about 2 percent.\nIf Carney comes back with 2 percent is that going to be enough for now? Or is it going to be “Let’s talk about 5?”\nIt depends on when he comes back with 2 percent. If he comes back with 2 percent on May 29, he’s in a good spot. If he has a plan to get there before 2030.\nHe’s in a better position, but he is going to have to recognize that on June 30, NATO and [Secretary of State Marco] Rubio and the president may come back to him and say, “Oh, well, it’ll happen before that.” The number only goes up if there’s a unanimous vote in NATO.\nSo if a vote is taken at the NATO leaders summit, we have a new target. That’s the state of play, right?\nThat’s the state of play. Whatever NATO decides.\nCould we talk again about cars and the relationship with Michigan? What’s your advice to Canadian auto workers right now? It’s got a deep economic impact. There’s a real connection to your state. What’s your best advice to these workers right now?\nI don’t give advice.\nWhat’s your message?\nMy message is the ball’s in your court. Send the signals that say, depending on what kind of deal you want, how do you see the relationship? If you’re negotiating to try to get the best deal of any country in the world, send some signals that that’s happening that you care deeply about this relationship, and you see it as a long term relationship, and America as a reliable somebody that you want as a reliable partner moving forward. Or if you see something else, maybe prohibit American products from being on Canadian shelves.\nWhat about going back to the status quo of USMCA? Is that a good deal? Is that a constructive proposal?\nNo, I think the president’s made it clear, we’re moving beyond USMCA.\nHe believes that his mandate is to reshore industries and reshape these relationships. And he’s going to do that.\nI’m assuming we will have another agreement. But exactly what that agreement is going to look like is going to be heavily dependent on what Canada comes back with.\nIs there a timeline on this? You mentioned that we have a throne speech. It’s a new government. You said maybe a defense target on May 29. But this summer, when do we restart this?\nThey’re doing deals right now.\nTo some countries, they’re saying, “Hey, come back with a better proposal,” or “We’re close enough here, let’s spend a few days going through it, and let’s talk about it, and let’s set up the framework.”\nThe Trump team, they’re working seven days a week. I don’t want to say they’re stretched, but they’re busy.\nThey’re negotiating with the whole world, right?\nThey’re negotiating with the whole world. If Canada comes back with a relatively straightforward proposal that the Trump administration sees as being a really serious proposal…\nWhat is one serious thing that he would like to see, do you think?\nI don’t think there’s one serious thing. “We’re going to partner with you, and this is what that means on critical minerals; we are going to commit to 2 percent on defense; we want to do a deal on the Arctic.”\nThere are certain throwaways for the Canadians to do right now that would send a positive signal. I mean, do you guys really want to ban American products, which is what you’re doing? That doesn’t send a very positive signal.\nWhat about Canadians not traveling to the U.S.? We’re seeing those numbers. What do you make of that?\nDo you really want to ban Americans from procurement projects? We haven’t banned any Canadian products. We haven’t said Canadian companies can’t bid for projects. Canadians want to travel to the U.S.? That’s an individual choice. That’s not our government’s choice. That’s individual Canadian choices.\nDo you feel it’s in your remit to maybe talk to Canadians about that?\nYou don’t want me talking to Canadians about that, because you don’t want to hear my opinion on it.\nI’m here to listen.\nBut I don’t think Canadians want my opinion on that. Okay? Because I feel very strongly about that. I think it’s outrageous that you banned American products from your shelves. That is an insult to us. We have not done anything like that.\nI don’t want to spend a bunch of time talking about the irritants in our relationship because there are two sides to this story in terms of irritants. And there are some on our side that maybe go back 20, 25 years. You don’t want to talk about military spending. We appreciate all the sacrifices that Canada shared with us in Afghanistan. Those types of things. But you agreed in 2014 that you would move to 2 percent [defense spending]. We are now in 2025, you’re nowhere close. That could be a huge irritant to American taxpayers. But we didn’t, say, kick Canadian products off our shelves.\nDo you see anything in Carney being able to do this quickly? He seems like he is doing a lot of things fast.\nThe United States, we’re ready to go fast.\nThe Trump administration, once they started talking with the Chinese, they did a framework, not a detailed 2,000-page, 5,000 page-agreement on every little thing, but they did it in two days.\nWith Canada, remember 94 percent of the trade between the U.S. and Canada is tariff free because the president stepped back some of his initial criteria, and said, ‘OK, if it falls under USMCA, it is tariff free.”\nI think we can get there if we can get Lutnick and [U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson] Greer and whoever’s there from the Canadian side, they can do it in the morning and still have time to go to Tim Hortons and get coffee and a donut. Lutnick can then call the president and say, “Hey, here’s the deal we got with Canada.” Maybe even call him from Tim Hortons.\nThat means the negotiation will happen up here?\nWe have Tim Hortons in the U.S. I don’t know if we got one in Washington, D.C. or not, but you can come to Holland, Michigan, because I know we have a Tim Hortons in Holland.\nI would love to have a coffee there with you.\nYes, absolutely.\nIf the signals are, “We are very serious. And here’s the framework, and here’s where we’re going,” I’m confident that Lutnick and Greer can sit down and negotiate this agreement and get a sign off from the president, because the president signs off on them all.\nIs President Trump a hard guy to work for because of his style? What’s it like?\nInvigorating. I wake up in the morning and it’s like, OK, we’ve got to deal with now. Monday morning, we got to deal with China, got a hostage released, did something on pharmaceuticals. Now we’re on Thursday, a trillion dollars plus a business coming out of this trip and oh, by the way, we got a new plane. That’s really, wow!\nDon’t want to jump around too much, but what is President Trump’s view of Canada’s presidency of the G7 and what does he want to see out of that meeting next month?\nI met with our sherpa this week. What they’re looking for out of the G7 is they’re looking for a statement that America can strongly endorse. If they can’t get to a statement that the U.S. agrees to, the U.S. is more than prepared to just say, “OK, on these seven or eight issues that have been outlined, if we can’t reach agreement as allies, that’s fine, too.”\nA lot of people are telling me that they’re happy that there’s a guy like you here, because they can talk to you and that you can interpret the president or talk about U.S. policy, as opposed to trying to divine it or watch things move fast. How do you see your role in doing that here in Canada?\nOne of my roles is to inform the president and his team of exactly what’s happening in Canada. They need to know who they’re negotiating with.\nThere have been people who have told me, “Well, Pete — this was before the meeting in the Oval Office — the president really doesn’t know what Canadians are talking about.”\nThat’s a naive statement. You talk about a media savvy team, it is the Trump team. They will know exactly what the Canadians and Carney are saying. It doesn’t mean that the president will bring it up in a conversation, but the president will go into the meeting fully aware of what his neighbors to the north think of America, and think of Donald Trump, and think of his team.\nMy job is to inform the president. My job is to help inform Canadians. Obviously, I can’t tell Canadians what to do. I can give them an idea as to, if you do that, this is maybe the kind of response you’re going to get. This will help us get to a deal.\nI am an advisor to the president, an advisor to Marco Rubio, but I work for the president on a daily basis. I’m responsible to Marco, but technically I’m appointed by the president. I have his phone number. If I need to call him, I can. But I have to be respectful of his time and respectful of my relationship to Rubio.\nIt is to inform on the relationship and move it in the direction that Donald Trump wants to move this relationship in. The president clearly indicated where he wanted this relationship to move, and now he’s waiting to see how Canada is going to respond.\nThey listened to each other, they expressed their views and they threw in a little bit of humor. That’s not a bad start to a relationship.",

    "article": "A series of budget deficits will test Newsom's relationships with key allies |  AP/Rich Pedroncelli\nBy Jeremy B. White\n05/17/2025 10:00 AM EDT\nLink Copied\nSACRAMENTO, California — Gavin Newsom’s final years of overseeing a massive state budget will be lonely ones.\nThe California governor, who has less than two years left in his last term and is widely considered a potential 2028 presidential contender, is facing intense backlash from close political allies over his plan to close a $12 billion shortfall — which included deep cuts to Planned Parenthood and health care for undocumented immigrants. Next year could be even worse as forecasters project deficits for years to come.\nIn a bitter twist, his nemesis in the White House is forcing many of these painful choices, ensuring months of brutal headlines for the ambitious Democrat. Economic upheaval from President Donald Trump’s trade policies, on top of yet-undetermined federal funding cuts, will likely drag state spending talks into the fall — a connection Newsom made clear as he released his plan with a reference to the “Trump slump.”\n\nThe governor will now spend his final stretch in Sacramento paring back some of those accomplishments, muddling his record and straining his relationships with supporters who cheered him during the flush years — many of whom he’d turn to for a presidential run.\n“Through no fault of his own, the governor’s going to have to navigate through a very difficult time,” said Democratic political consultant Darry Sragow. “He’s going to have to make very hard decisions and be prepared to take a lot of heat. He may lose friends, he may lose political standing.”\nThe gloomy finale — which will shadow his next political move — is a stark reversal from years of booming surpluses that allowed Newsom to enshrine legacy projects like universal health care and early childhood education, send voters rebate checks, and deliver for influential players like organized labor.\nLongstanding allies in the California Medical Association and Planned Parenthood lambasted the governor for cutting reproductive health dollars and Medicaid services. Immigration advocates and Democratic lawmakers excoriated him for seeking to cap health insurance enrollment for undocumented immigrants. Unions blasted his proposals to cut money for long-term caregivers and childcare workers.\nThe broadsides came with a biting message: Newsom is shirking the kind of leadership he champions to counter Trump, cutting Medi-Cal in the midst of federal efforts to shrink Medicaid.\n\n“The proposed budget is catastrophically misguided given where we are as a country,” said Assemblymember Alex Lee, head of the Legislature’s progressive caucus.\nSEIU California Executive Director Tia Orr — who’s typically reserved in criticizing a governor who has helped her union group secure major wins — warned the budget fundamentally misreads a political moment in which Democrats are struggling to connect with many voters.\n“In this past election, we saw so many questions about what electeds are going to bring to working-class individuals,” Orr said. His budget, she added, “is one that I’d call more centered on the wealthy, protecting CEOs and those with vast wealth.”\nNewsom has pinned much of the blame on Trump, estimating tariffs would bleed some $16 billion from state coffers by undercutting core industries and convulsing the stock market.\nBut the governor oversaw a costly and politically combustible state spending initiative — the expansion of a program offering free health insurance to undocumented immigrants — even as Republican foes warned about the price tag. Newsom called the program both fiscally prudent and morally laudable.\nNow he is retrenching. His proposal would cap the enrollment of undocumented adults and charge them a monthly premium . The governor has insisted he is stabilizing the program, not walking away from it. But in doing so, he has managed to both infuriate the program’s liberal supporters and reinvigorate Republican attacks about excessive government spending — fodder for rivals to his left and right in a national campaign.\n“He’s trying to blame Trump and tariffs for his budget deficit when it’s been very clear this deficit was coming, it was just a matter of how big it was going to be,” said Assembly Minority Leader James Gallagher. “We’re continuing to fund healthcare for illegal immigrants, and it’s not sustainable.”\n\nThe budget proposal preserves some of Newsom’s biggest legacy projects, like universal pre-kindergarten for 4-year-olds, that he built across multiple budget cycles. During his budget presentation, he touted the state’s booming GDP as a sign of its continued economic dynamism — a goal that former and current aides describe as a central part of Newsom’s fiscal vision.\n“What the governor believes is that California is the example of progressive pluralism that is also economically dominant,” said former administration official Jason Elliott. “In order for the right-wing ideology to be correct, California can’t succeed.”\nBut despite the pace of new patents and initial public offerings, voters living in the world’s fourth-largest economy are still feeling profoundly pessimistic about the economy — and the polling shows it.\nNewsom’s approval ratings have dipped underwater, and voters have overwhelmingly concluded he’s more focused on his national prospects than on fixing his state’s problems. A drumbeat of headlines about deficits and cuts is unlikely to turn that around, noted Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll director Mark DiCamillo.\n“The last two years could be consequential,” DiCamillo said. “If things turn negative for California, which looks likely to happen, I don’t think he’ll end up with positive job approval ratings.”",
