    "article": "While Donald Trump is skipping a visit to Israel during his ongoing Mideast travels, the ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza has been a significant part of discussions, as the US president dismissed claims that the Jewish state is being sidelined by his trip.\n“This is good for Israel,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, in response to a question about skipping a stop in Israel. “Having a relationship like I have with these countries… I think it’s very good for Israel.”\nThe US president added that the White House might deserve “the most credit” for the release on Monday from Gaza of Israeli-US hostage Edan Alexander, and said if it weren’t for the US, “probably none of the hostages would be living right now.”\nAsked aboard the flight whether Israel deserves any credit for the release of  Alexander, Trump said: “Well, they’ve been fighting a long time, they’re warring, and I think they deserve a lot of credit.\n“I think my people deserve a lot of credit. Maybe the most credit,” he added. “Look, [Alexander] wouldn’t be there. If it weren’t for us, he wouldn’t be living right now. Probably none of the hostages would be living right now. We probably have 20 that are living, that we’ll be getting out step by step.”\nAlexander was released Monday from Gaza in what was described as a goodwill gesture from the Palestinian terror group Hamas to Trump ahead of the US president’s visit to the region.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Wednesday afternoon that the premier held a series of lengthy discussions with Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and the Israeli hostage negotiating team, which Witkoff has joined in Doha.\nWitkoff, who headed from Tel Aviv to Doha on Tuesday, arriving shortly before Trump landed there, met with senior Qatari officials in the presence of families of hostages being held in Gaza, according to Al Jazeera, which said the meeting lasted two and a half hours.\nNetanyahu agreed to send a delegation to Doha after speaking with Trump on Monday and meeting with Witkoff and US Ambassador Mike Huckabee, stressing at the time that “the negotiations will take place only under fire.”\nSpeaking in Riyadh earlier Wednesday, Trump told Gulf leaders that he hopes for the “future of safety and dignity of the Palestinian people” in Gaza, but that it cannot happen under Hamas, who “delight in raping, torturing and murdering innocent people.”\nAttending a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council in the Saudi capital, Trump said he “greatly appreciates” the role of the Gulf countries in trying to “bring this terrible conflict to an end, including securing the release of American hostage Edan Alexander.”\n“We thought Edan was dead,” he said, adding that “ultimately, all hostages of all nationalities must be released as a stepping stone to peace.”\nSpeaking to journalists after the Gulf summit, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud declared that the US and Saudi Arabia “agree to end the war in Gaza and release all hostages.”\nHe said the US administration is willing to make “very courageous decisions” to push toward a ceasefire in Gaza, and “open up pathways to resolving the broader issues of Palestine,” including “moving toward, one hopes, a Palestinian state,” according to a New York Times report.\nThe US did not issue a similar statement regarding any agreements reached with the Saudis about the war in Gaza.\nAl-Saud also said: “We need to reach a ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible,” adding that “without a ceasefire in Gaza, it would be difficult to supply aid” to the enclave.\nTurkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a relentless critic of Israel, who joined Trump’s talks with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa via video, thanked Trump in a speech for “promising me that he will act to end the worsening humanitarian disaster in Gaza.”\nIsrael has threatened to launch its major military operation in Gaza once Trump leaves the Mideast on Friday if Hamas doesn’t agree to a hostage deal by then.\nNetanyahu told his coalition partners on Monday that despite sending a negotiating team to Doha, his position hasn’t changed. The negotiators only have a mandate to discuss what the premier has referred to as the “Witkoff proposal,” which would see as many as half of the hostages released in exchange for a weekslong ceasefire. During that truce, Israel is prepared to hold talks regarding a permanent end to the war, but will accept nothing less than Hamas agreeing to disarm and give up governing control of Gaza.\nHamas has said it is prepared to cede control of the Strip and agree to a yearslong truce with Israel that includes security guarantees. However, it has long refused demands that it permanently disarm.\nIt has also demanded guarantees from the mediators — potentially in the form of a binding UN Security Council resolution — that Israel be prevented from resuming the war if Hamas agrees to release hostages. Arab mediators say they face an uphill battle convincing Hamas to release hostages without assurances that Israel will end the war because the previous deal signed in January was supposed to see the sides enter talks regarding the terms of a permanent ceasefire, but Netanyahu largely refused to do so and the truce collapsed in March after its first of three phases.\nNurit Yohanan, Jacob Magid and Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.",

    "date": "Updated 05:52 AM GMT+5:30, May 15, 2025",
    "article": "A Palestinian terrorist opened fire on Israeli vehicles on Wednesday night in the northern West Bank, striking a pregnant woman who was en route to a hospital to deliver her baby, along with her husband, the military and medics said.\nAccording to the Israel Defense Forces, soldiers monitoring surveillance cameras spotted the terrorist only as he opened fire, and immediately dispatched troops to the area.\nThe woman, identified as Tzeela Gez, 30, was rushed to Petah Tikva’s Rabin Medical Center in critical condition.\nDuring efforts to save her life, doctors performed an emergency C-section to deliver her baby, the medical center said. The newborn was listed in serious condition and was transferred to Schneider Children’s Hospital within the compound, where doctors were working to save his life.\nShortly after dawn on Thursday, the hospital announced Gez’s death.\nIDF surveillance camera footage showed the terrorist fleeing the scene immediately after the gunfire.\nGez, a mother of three, was in her ninth month of pregnancy and was heading from the family’s home in the Bruchin settlement to a hospital to give birth, local authorities said.\nHer husband, Hananel, who was driving the car, was lightly hurt, the hospital said after his condition was initially listed as serious.\nHamas praised the killing as “heroic,” and called for more such acts, but did not claim responsibility.\nIn a message that according to Hebrew media was sent to a family WhatsApp group, Hananel wrote, “Today is a sad day. Last night, my wife was murdered. We were on our way to the hospital to give birth to our fourth child.\n“Obviously, I am broken,” he continued. “This is natural. But I thank God that I am alive, and I will be strong in order to continue to be a light to the world. Because we will never let them break us.”\n“I am very, very sad,” he wrote. “But I will continue to fight for the welfare of our people… We will survive, succeed, and prosper.”\nGez’s sister, Shaked Force, told the Ynet outlet that the pregnancy had been complicated.\n“She really put in an effort. She was always smiling and gave all her strength, always there for others. I don’t have the words to describe such an amazing character,” she said.\nForce said their parents “straight away knew of the disaster, knew that she was seriously injured, and when we got to the hospital, they couldn’t bear it.”\nTal Shahar Carmon, a close friend of Tzeela Gez, told the Kan public broadcaster about the “unbearably difficult” moment when Hananel explained to his three other children what had happened.\n“He told them that with Mom they traveled to bring the new baby, and on the way a terrorist shot at Mom, and Dad tried to save her, and they did everything, and they managed to save the baby but not Mom,” she recalled.\nGez, who was active on social media, worked as a trauma, anxiety, and relationships therapist. In the past, she posted videos and messages encouraging her followers to maintain their spirits despite the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.\n“Another moment I am grateful that I am breathing, that I am present and that I am here,” she wrote on Facebook in December 2023, two months after the devastating Hamas-led invasion of southern Israel, which caused the war. “From here, all I want to do is be active and spread light; even a small smile is spreading light.”\nThe IDF said it launched a manhunt for the terrorist who fired at several vehicles on Route 446 outside the Bruchin settlement, where the couple was from.\nThe military said it dispatched troops and an Israeli Air Force drone for the manhunt, and that soldiers encircled and blocked the entrances to the adjacent Palestinian town of Bruqin.\nThe IDF believed the attack was carried out by a sole terrorist, leading it to reorganize its deployment near Bruchin and to work to defoliate the area from which the gunfire was carried out\nMeanwhile, the IDF was continuing to surround Bruqin and another Palestinian town, Kafr ad-Dik, amid the hunt for the terrorist.\nPalestinian media reported that some Palestinians were forced to sleep in their cars overnight because they were prevented from getting home.\nIDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir vowed to find the killers as he visited the scene.\n“This is a difficult and painful attack in which an Israeli civilian was killed on her way to a delivery room. I share in the deep sorrow of the family. We are engaged in broad fighting against terror in Judea and Samaria (West Bank), and we will continue,” Zamir said in remarks published by the IDF.\n“We will activate all our tools, and we will reach the murderers to bring them to justice,” he added.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was “deeply shocked by the horrific terrorist attack.”\n“This abhorrent incident precisely reflects the difference between us, who desire and bring life, and the reprehensible terrorists, whose goal is to kill us and destroy life,” he said in the statement released by his office.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz offered his condolences to the Gez family and prayers for the welfare of the newborn baby.\n“We will continue to fight terror with great force” in all areas of the West Bank and “will not allow it to raise its head,” he said.\nKatz said he had instructed the IDF to find those responsible for the attack and vowed “those who support and sponsor terror will pay a heavy price.”\nFar-right ministers in the coalition called for a military offensive in the West Bank similar to the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which has left most of the enclave in ruins.\nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X, “The burning pain and the cruelty of the sub-humans is incomprehensible.”\n“Just as we are flattening Rafah, Khan Younis, and Gaza, we must also flatten the terror nests” in the West Bank, he said.\nAllied far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir posted that the attack was “a painful reminder — the war is not only in Gaza.”\nHe then recalled a controversial remark he made in the past that “the right of the [Israeli] residents overrides that of the rights of Palestinian Authority residents to movement.”\nHe called on Netanyahu to instruct the IDF “to immediately and permanently” bring back all the checkpoints in the West Bank and to advance legislation to require a death sentence for terrorists.\nOpposition leader MK Yair Lapid offered his condolences to the Gez family and prayers for the injured baby.\n“Terror will not break us,” he posted to X, adding that he trusts the security forces to find “all those who had a hand in the terror attack and bring them to justice.”\nHead of the Shomron Regional Council Yossi Dagan said of Gez that she was “a devoted, loving, and smiling woman who only asked to live a quiet life–and she was murdered on her way to bring life [to the world].”\nDagan criticized security authorities, saying, “This is an area of repeated attacks, and the response by Israel can’t just be announcements to the media.”\nThe West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip ignited the war there.\nSince then, troops have arrested some 6,000 wanted Palestinians across the West Bank, including more than 2,350 affiliated with Hamas. According to the Palestinian Authority health ministry, more than 950 West Bank Palestinians have been killed in that time. The IDF says the vast majority of them were gunmen killed in exchanges of fire, rioters who clashed with troops or terrorists carrying out attacks.\nThere has also been a significant increase in settler violence against Palestinians since the start of the war.\nDuring the same period, 52 people, including Israeli security personnel, have been killed in terror attacks in Israel and the West Bank. Another eight members of the security forces were killed in clashes with terror operatives in the West Bank.",

    "subheading": "Adviser to Iran’s supreme leader says Islamic Republic would curb enrichment, promise not to pursue nuclear weapons, and allow inspectors — if the US lifted sanctions ‘immediately’",
    "date": "Updated 12:35 PM GMT+5:30, May 15, 2025",
    "article": "US President Donald Trump said Thursday that a deal was close on Iran’s nuclear program, voicing optimism about the chances for avoiding a military strike on Tehran’s sites.\n“We’re getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this,” he said, referring to military action.\n“Iran has sort of agreed to the terms. They’re not going to make, I call it in a friendly way, ‘nuclear dust’,” Trump said, apparently referring to uranium enrichment.\n“It’s very simple,” Trump said in Qatar, the second of three stops during his four-day tour of the Middle East, referring to military intervention. “It’s not like I have to give you 30 pages worth of details. There’s only one sentence: They can’t have a nuclear weapon.”\nHe indicated that the threat of military intervention remained. “There’s a very, very nice step and there’s a violent step — violence like people haven’t seen before.”\nBut, he stressed, “I don’t want to do the second step. Some people do. Many people do. I don’t want to do that step. So we’ll see what happens. But we’re in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace, and if we do that, it’ll be fantastic,” he added.\nIt was not immediately clear what “long-term peace” meant in this context.\nTrump last month quashed Israeli proposals for a series of joint strikes that would have taken place this month on Iranian nuclear facilities, opting instead to try for a diplomatic solution to the problem of Tehran’s nuclear program, The New York Times reported on April 16.\nThe US and Iran held their fourth round of indirect talks over the weekend, in their highest-level contact since the United States in 2018 pulled out of a previous 2015 nuclear deal.\nOil prices immediately dropped after Thursday’s comments by Trump, who said he was basing his optimism on new statements by Iran.\n“You probably read today the story about Iran,” Trump said, when claiming that Iran had “sort of agreed” to the terms of a deal.  The president did not specify which remarks he was referring to, but a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ali Khamenei told NBC News on Wednesday that Iran was ready to sign a nuclear deal with certain conditions in exchange for Trump lifting economic sanctions.\nAli Shamkhani said Iran would commit to never making nuclear weapons, get rid of its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, enrich uranium only to the lower levels needed for civilian use, and allow international inspectors to supervise the process, in exchange for the immediate lifting of all economic sanctions.\nTrump posted a link to the NBC interview on his Truth Social platform.\nUS officials have offered varying statements regarding whether they’ll accept a deal that allows Iran to maintain a limited enrichment program, though more recently have asserted that they won’t.\nIran, which openly seeks Israel’s destruction, has ramped up its enrichment of uranium to 60 percent purity, which has no peaceful application, and has obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities.\nTrump said Thursday that Iran should “say a big thank you” to Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who had pressed the US leader to avoid military action against his country’s giant neighbor.\n“Iran is very lucky to have the emir because he’s actually fighting for them. He doesn’t want us to do a vicious blow to Iran,” Trump said.\nThe previous evening, while attending a state dinner, Trump also expressed his desire for a peaceful resolution to Iran’s nuclear program, but reiterated that the US would take action in the absence of a deal.\n“The non-friendly is a violent course and I don’t want that,” Trump said on Wednesday, saying of the Iranians, “It’s their decision,” while urging Qatar to help reach an agreement.\n“It’s a perilous situation, and we want to do the right thing,” he said. “We want to do something that’s going to save maybe millions of lives. Because things like that get started and they get out of control.”\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Wednesday said Iran will not “bow to any bully,” in response to Trump’s criticism of Tehran during his Gulf tour.\n“He thinks he can come here, chant slogans and scare us. For us, martyrdom is far sweeter than dying in bed. You came to frighten us? We will not bow to any bully,” Pezeshkian said in comments broadcast live on state TV.\nDespite the talks, Washington has continued to impose sanctions targeting Iran’s nuclear program, its oil industry, and its ballistic missile program.\nAn adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Ali Shamkhani, told NBC News on Wednesday that Trump “talks about the olive branch, which we have not seen. It’s all barbed wire.”\nIn the interview, however, Shamkhani said “yes” to the proposition that, were the sanctions removed “immediately,” Tehran could agree to never develop nuclear weapons, give up stockpiles of highly enriched uranium and allow inspectors to nuclear sites, among other steps.\nThe United States on Wednesday unveiled fresh sanctions against six people and 12 firms — including several based in China and Hong Kong — for their support of Iran’s ballistic missile program.\nThe sanctions are aimed at organizations involved in “efforts to help the Iranian regime domestically source the manufacturing of critical materials needed for Tehran’s ballistic missile program,” according to the US Treasury Department.\n“The United States cannot allow Iran to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.\nTehran’s attempts to produce missiles and components domestically “represents an unacceptable threat to the United States and the stability of the region,” he added.\nThose sanctioned include three Chinese nationals — Qin Jinhua, Qin Dehui, and Wang Chao — who work for a China-based firm which has exported carbon fiber precursor materials to a sanctioned Iranian firm, and another Hong Kong-based company.\n“Iran remains heavily reliant on China to conduct its malign activities in the Middle East,” US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement.\n“This is another example of how the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) and China-based companies provide key economic and technical support to Iran and its proxies,” she added.\nOn Tuesday the United States announced fresh sanctions on Iranian oil sales to China, as Trump’s administration continues its “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran while backing ongoing nuclear talks.\nThe sanctions follow similar designations in recent weeks, at the same time as Washington and Tehran have stepped up nuclear talks.",

    "subheading": "Witkoff holds two-hour call with Netanyahu, but fails to extract major compromise; US pressure on parties expected to ramp up in next 48 hours; Hamas showing flexibility on disarmament",
    "date": "Updated 03:10 AM GMT+5:30, May 15, 2025",
    "article": "Hostage negotiations kicked off in Doha on Wednesday with renewed energy and optimism from US mediators following Hamas’s release of American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, but an Israeli and an Arab official told The Times of Israel that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s refusal to accept proposals that commit Jerusalem to permanently ending the war in Gaza significantly limit the chances for success.\nStill, US special envoy to the Mideast Steve Witkoff is leaning hard on both Israel and Hamas to compromise and will stick with it through at least the Friday conclusion of US President Donald Trump’s Mideast trip, the Israeli official said, adding that the negotiations may extend further if they remain substantive but need a little more time.\nFor its part, Israel has pledged to launch a new massive military operation to reoccupy and hold onto the entire Strip indefinitely if Hamas does not agree to what it has called the “Witkoff proposal” by the end of Trump’s trip. This proposal envisions the release of as many as half of the remaining living hostages in exchange for a weekslong ceasefire, during which Israel would agree to hold talks regarding the terms of an end to the war without committing up front to such a result.\nHamas has pushed back on this framework, insisting on guarantees that the war will end before it releases additional hostages. It has pointed to Israel’s refusal to hold talks on a permanent ceasefire earlier this year, even though it had agreed to do so as part of the ceasefire inked in January, which collapsed after its first stage in March.\nThe terror group has proposed releasing all of the hostages at once in exchange for an end to the war, but Netanyahu has rejected this trade, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power. Successive polls have indicated that the premier is out of step with the majority of Israelis who back such a framework. But Netanyahu is also facing pressure from his far-right coalition partners, who have threatened to collapse the government if he were to end the war in exchange for the remaining 58 hostages — between 20 and 23 of whom are believed to still be alive.\nWhile Netanyahu has stuck to the “Witkoff proposal” from earlier this year, the Israeli official said the US envoy has moved away from this proposal and is instead pushing frameworks that more definitively include a permanent end to the war, while removing Hamas from power in Gaza.\nWitkoff held a phone call with Netanyahu for over two hours on Wednesday during which the US envoy sought to push the prime minister toward his new framework, but did not make significant progress, the Israeli official said.\nThe Arab official said Hamas has indicated willingness to show flexibility on the issue of disarmament if Israel agrees to end the war and withdraw its forces from Gaza. The terror group has already said it was prepared to transfer governing power to an independent committee of Palestinian technocrats.\nEgyptian and Qatari mediators have also been pushing Hamas to accept an initial ceasefire of several months — longer than the 45-day ceasefire that Netanyahu has said it is prepared to accept — that includes assurances from the mediators that they will ensure Israel remains at the negotiating table during that time to hash out the terms of a permanent end to the war and that it doesn’t resume fighting in the meantime, the Arab official said.\nQatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari appeared to confirm this effort, telling the local Al Araby Al Jadeed newspaper that the mediators’ current goal is to reach an initial ceasefire that is longer than the truce from earlier this year, which lasted six weeks, and provides an opportunity for the parties to reach additional agreements.\n“There are still challenges, but President Trump’s visit has given momentum to the negotiations,” al-Ansari said.\nAl-Ansari said that the new talks in Doha revolve around a US-backed proposal for an extended truce, the release of the remaining hostages and talks about the future of the Gaza Strip.\nLater Wednesday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told CNN that Israel’s sustained airstrikes this week send the signal that it is not interested in negotiating a ceasefire\nAmong the various meetings held in Qatar on Wednesday was a sit-down between Witkoff and senior Qatari negotiators, in the presence of several hostage families. The meeting was said by Al Jazeera to have lasted for some two-and-a-half hours.\nWitkoff was in the Gulf state along with Trump, who made Qatar the second stop on a three-country tour that started in Saudi Arabia on Monday and will end in the United Arab Emirates on Friday.\nMeanwhile, an American source denied an Arabic media report that Witkoff had met directly with senior Hamas officials.\nWhile no major breakthroughs were made by late Wednesday night, the Israeli and Arab officials said they expect US pressure to intensify over the next 48 hours.\nAn Israeli negotiating team made up of the former Shin Bet deputy chief, Netanyahu’s diplomatic adviser Ophir Falk and the government’s hostage point-man Gal Hirsch remains in Doha for continued discussions, though the Israeli official said their mandate is very limited. Witkoff understood this when he chose to pick up the phone and speak directly with Netanyahu on Wednesday, the official added.\nDuring a meeting Witkoff held with hostage families on Tuesday in Tel Aviv, one of the participants was recorded asking the US envoy why the US wasn’t pressuring Netanyahu to end the war. Witkoff could be heard responding that Israel is a sovereign country and that Washington wouldn’t force Jerusalem to make such a decision.\nChannel 12 quoted a senior Israeli official familiar with the hostage talks as having said that “the Americans have an attitude of ‘take it or leave it,’ or we’re gone. They are determined that whoever doesn’t go with them will lose a lot.”\nIsrael is also hoping that it will soon know the results of its Tuesday strike targeting Hamas’s Gaza leader Muhammad Sinwar, who it has viewed as an obstacle to the kinds of deals it has hoped to reach, the Israeli official said, expressing hope that his elimination would swing the power balance toward Hamas’s leadership abroad.\nIf Sinwar’s death is confirmed, the mediators are hoping that Israel will agree to put off its military operation in order to give time for Hamas to regroup and determine its decision-making framework, the Arab official said.\nNurit Yohanan contributed to this report.",

    "subheading": "Police in Antwerp looking for rabbis conducting the religious rite without medical license; Jewish group says raids part of larger campaign of intimidation against Jews in Belgium",
    "date": "Updated 06:52 PM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "Belgium police conducted a series of raids on Wednesday in Jewish homes in Antwerp looking for people illegally conducting ritual Jewish circumcisions, local officials said.\nPolice conducted raids on three locations in Antwerp’s Jewish Quarter and nearby Green Quarter seeking knives and other equipment used in circumcisions, according to local reports. No one was arrested.\nPolice are concerned that the brit milah ritual is being performed on Jewish baby boys by unlicensed mohels (people who perform circumcision) instead of professional doctors. The ritual is commonly done in a synagogue, not a medical institution, by people who may not have undergone receive comprehensive medical training.\n“The problem is that there is no clear law regarding circumcision at the moment,” Belgian MP Michael Freilich, the country’s only Orthodox Jewish lawmaker, told The Times of Israel.\nWhile there are no laws specifically regulating Jewish ritual circumcision, Belgium has laws mandating that all medical procedures must be performed by a licensed doctor.\nFreilich, who works with the European Union on Jewish matters in his position as the European Jewish Association’s diplomatic envoy for issues of antisemitism and Holocaust remembrance, is working on developing EU certification for mohels, but that is likely years away, he noted.\nUntil then, the situation is precarious for Jews looking to perform the biblically prescribed religious ritual with a traditional mohel.\n“This is a very sad day. On one hand, Jews must obviously respect the laws of their countries,” Freilich said. “On the other hand, there has been a policy until now of the government turning a blind eye to this issue. The problem is not that brit milah is not allowed; it’s that there needs to be a clearer law about who can perform the procedure. We need to work together to find a solution.”\nEuropean Jewish Association chairman Rabbi Menachem Margolin condemned the raids, calling them part of a larger campaign of intimidation against Jewish religious figures in Belgium.\n“Following the ban on ritual slaughter [in a 2019 law that requires that animals be stunned before they can be slaughtered for food], the harassment of mohels represents a further red line and a clear warning sign to Belgian Jews and the Belgian government,” Margolin said. “Any restriction on circumcision in Belgium would send a clear message to Belgian Jews that they are not welcome in the country.”\nBelgian MP Michael Freilich speaking to an audience in a synagogue in Belgium. (Courtesy)\nProsecutors in Antwerp, where most of Belgium’s approximately 30,000 Jews live, have been investigating illegal circumcisions since a renegade member of the Jewish community filed a series of complaints.\nIn November 2023, Rabbi Moshe Aryeh Friedman, an anti-Zionist activist from New York living in Antwerp, complained to police that six mohels were endangering children by using a controversial custom known as metzitzah b’peh in the circumcision process.\nThe practice involves mohels using their lips to suck blood from the penises of babies on whom they’d performed the Jewish ritual.\nThe controversial custom is thought to have caused the death of at least one child in New York in 2012 from herpes. Another outbreak among infants of Haredi families in New York occurred in 2017 and was attributed to metzitzah b’peh.\nThen, in September 2024, Friedman informed police that circumcisions were being performed without legal approvals, and a local television station reported on the issue, stoking local concern.\n“The only reason this is happening now is because of Friedman,” Freilich said. “That doesn’t mean it would never have happened, but he made it go much faster.”\nUnlicensed circumcisions are under increased scrutiny in Europe. Last summer, authorities in Ireland arrested a rabbi from London for allegedly performing circumcision without required medical credentials in what may be the first case in modern Europe of a rabbi arrested in connection with a brit milah.\nCircumcision is relatively uncommon among the general population of Europe, with only 10-20% of males having gone under the knife, compared to over 70% in the United States.\nMuslims generally undergo circumcision at a hospital, not in a religious ceremony, so the legislation is primarily a Jewish issue.\nMost countries do not have any specific legislation regarding circumcision, allowing the Jewish ritual to continue as a religious freedom without intervening, Freilich explained. Only Germany has a law specifically allowing non-medical practitioners to conduct the brit milah under appropriate medical and hygienic conditions.\nFreilich hopes to work with other European governments to adopt similar legislation allowing circumcision. He is also trying to encourage the EU to recognize certified mohels, he said.",

According to Dr. Noé D. Michael from the IAA and the University of Cologne in Germany, one of the paper’s authors, the finding is unprecedented.\n“As far as we know, no such figurine had ever been identified in Israel, Jordan, and our region,” he told The Times of Israel over the phone.\nTel Malhata stands on a strategic location at the crossroads of two prominent ancient roads, one connecting Aila (near the bay of Aqaba, Jordan) with Jerusalem, and the other leading from the port of Gaza to the Dead Sea.\nThe artifacts were found in two graves next to each other. One contained the remains of a woman between the ages of 20 and 40, and the second was of a child who was six to eight years old.\n“We believe that since the tombs were close and presented the same kind of burial gifts, they were probably a mother and a child,” Michael said. “Unfortunately, we could not extract DNA remains from the bones to run a test.”\nIn addition to the ebony figurines, archaeologists also found three bone figurines.\n“Bone figurines are rare but not unique,” Michael noted.\nThe expert explained that many tombs from that period, especially those of women and children, presented burial gifts such as jewelry, glassware, coins, and other objects.\n“It is a well-known phenomenon in tombs from Byzantine times, which was attested in cemeteries also outside of Israel,” he said. “Men were only rarely buried with such gifts.”\nEbony is a high-end type of dark wood used for millennia to make furniture and luxurious items.\n“Experts at Tel Aviv University tested the wood and confirmed it came from India or Sri Lanka,” Michael said. “An ebony trade between Asia and Egypt and the Horn of Africa is attested starting from the 4th century CE.”\nThe researchers believe that the figurines were carved in Africa based on the facial features of the humans they depict.\nOne of the findings consists of a broken head approximately 1.5 centimeters high (0.6 inch) and less than 1 centimeter wide, portraying a woman. The other presents the head, chest, and upper arms of a man with long hair. Both have a hole that allowed their owners to wear the artifacts as necklaces.\n“The figurines present African facial features,” said Michael. “We believe that they depict people rather than gods, and therefore, our hypothesis is that they were ancestors of the deceased.”\nWhile no Christian symbols were found in the tomb, the position of the bodies, which were laid on their back with the heads pointing towards the west, has allowed the researchers to determine that the burials were Christians.\nMichael explained that the Horn of Africa was Christianized around the 6th century CE, roughly the same period when the woman and the child died.\n“For some reason, possibly related to trade, they probably moved north,” he said.\nThe cemetery at Tel Malhata was in use between the 3rd and the beginning of the 8th centuries CE. It presents several hundred graves, predominantly Christian but also some pagans from the late Roman period and Muslims from the early Islamic period (7th and 8th centuries CE.) However, no Jewish tombs have been identified. According to Michael, religious affiliation can be determined by both the findings in the grave and the position of the bodies – in the Islamic period, they pointed toward Mecca.\nIn the Roman Period, Tel Malhata featured a fortified structure that served as either a fortress or an agricultural estate with a protective tower. Briefly abandoned at the beginning of the 3rd century, it was resettled in the late 3rd/early 4th century. According to Michael, during the Byzantine period (324-336 CE), the town had as many as 5,000 residents, making it a significant center in the Negev.\n“However, we do not know much about the town, as it has not been properly excavated yet,” he said.\nThe cemetery is located south of the settlement.\n“It was first dug in the 1980s,” Michael said. “So far, archaeologists have excavated some 300 graves.”\nThe ebony figurines were found during the 2017 excavation season.\nWhile the mystery of the woman and child’s identity will likely never be solved, they were probably not the only nonnative people buried in the cemetery.\n“Since Tel Malhata was located on these important trade routes, many people passed through it,” Michael said. “We can see it in the numerous exotic findings we have unearthed, including some rare alabaster jewelry and jars.”",

    "article": "JTA — Organizers of a community garden in Ridgewood in the New York borough of Queens that required members to oppose Zionism may now lose their city license.\nApplicants to the Sunset Community Garden were asked to sign a “statement of values” that included opposition to Zionism, antisemitism and “nationalist and/or racist beliefs.”\nIn an April 16 letter, the New York City Parks Department informed leaders of the garden that the statement had violated guidelines. The department told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that the application “required prospective members to affirm the group’s political and ideological viewpoints,” and added, ”Such litmus tests as a barrier to membership are not permitted, regardless of the ideological content.”\nThe garden had also gotten into a dispute with the city over the installation of a memorial for Cecilia Gentili, an activist for the rights of transgender people and sex workers.\n“We’ve been working with the Sunset Community Garden group since September 2024 to address several violations,” said Chris Clark, a press officer for NYC Parks, in an emailed statement. “Unfortunately, the group has not abided by the rules upheld by every other GreenThumb community garden even after Parks met with them and repeatedly offered solutions. As these issues have not been addressed, we have moved to terminate the license agreement.”\nClark said the termination had “nothing to do with members’ political beliefs or gender expression, but rather the repeated refusal by group leadership to address outstanding issues.”\nIf the license is revoked, the garden will remain open and will be managed under new operators.\nThe garden also faced scrutiny last September when local residents complained about the group’s anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian activism, which included a a teach-in with the “Poppies 4 Palestine” project and “Free Palestine” poster-making events, according to the New York Post.\nLast week, the Poppies 4 Palestine Instagram page posted a list of demands for the NYC Parks Department related to the dispute over the Gentili memorial.\nThe group asked the city to “prevent predatory tactics” and allow “clear due process for advocacy when gardens face harassment from GreenThumb [the city’s community garden program], Parks, elected officials, or other bad-faith actors (including racist, Zionist, transphobic, or otherwise oppressive forces).”\n“In repeated efforts to collaborate with GreenThumb, we’ve faced deliberate obstruction: unclear communication, harassment, threats, and ever-shifting demands that have now escalated to the erasure of community agreements,” said Poppies for Palestine in the post. “This isn’t negligence -— it’s a pattern of suppression. We refuse to let them bury our collective work under bureaucratic violence.”\nOne garden member, Nastazia Kielar, told the Gothamist web site that many in her community “see Zionism as a form of colonization still,” and that the garden was being treated unfairly.\nThe group told the Hell Gate site that complaints about the garden gained steam in a private Facebook group called “Zionist Brooklyn.”\n“They’re calling New York Parks Commissioner Sue Donoghue’s office to complain about us and alleging that we are teaching children to hate Jewish people,” a garden member identified only as Dana told Hell Gate. “It’s a weird witch-hunt type thing that’s happening -— the anti-woke mob, essentially.”",

    "article": "Palestinian media on Wednesday evening reported fresh strikes near a hospital in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip where the Israel Defense Forces targeted Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar in a massive strike the day before.\nAfter the original strikes on Tuesday targeted an underground command compound below the European Hospital where Sinwar was believed to be sheltering, the IDF has since bombed the area several times, in an apparent attempt to prevent anyone from approaching the tunnel beneath the medical center.\nOne strike on Wednesday morning near the hospital hit a bulldozer, according to Palestinian media, wounding several people.\nThe military has not commented on the additional strikes on the hospital.\nThe IDF has not yet confirmed whether Sinwar, the younger brother of former Hamas leader and October 7 terror mastermind Yahya Sinwar, was killed in the strike.\nThe military was also into the possibility that other senior Hamas officials, including the commander of the terror group’s Rafah Brigade, Mohammad Shabana, were with him at the time of the strike.\nContrary to several reports, Israeli officials believed that Hamas military wing spokesman Hudhaifa Kahlout, known by the nom de guerre “Abu Obeida,” was not with Sinwar in the bunker.\nMeanwhile, Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip since Wednesday morning killed over 100 people, according to tallies from the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry and civil defense agency, with at least 34 people reportedly killed in IDF strikes on Thursday morning alone. The figures could not be verified and do not differentiate between civilians and terror operatives.\nHamas civil defense spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP on Thursday morning that at least 13 people were “recovered from rubble” after a strike in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, while another 20 were killed in five strikes across the Gaza Strip, and one woman was killed in artillery shelling in southern Gaza.\nMeanwhile, a separate civil defense official, Mohammed al-Mughayyir, told AFP 80 people had been killed by Israeli strikes on Wednesday, including 59 in the north.\nAt least 50 people, including 22 children, were killed in strikes around northern Gaza’s Jabalia alone, according to hospitals and Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry.\nAFP footage from the aftermath of a strike in Jabalia showed mounds of rubble and twisted metal from collapsed buildings. Palestinians, including young children, picked through the debris in search of belongings.\nFootage of mourners in northern Gaza showed women in tears as they kneeled next to bodies wrapped in bloodstained white shrouds.\n“It’s a nine-month-old baby. What did he do?” one of them cried out.\nHasan Moqbel, a Palestinian who lost relatives, told AFP: “Those who don’t die from airstrikes die from hunger, and those who don’t die from hunger die from lack of medicine.”\nThe IDF on Wednesday had urged residents in part of a Gaza City neighborhood to evacuate, warning that its forces would “attack the area with intense force.”\nThe areas threatened by the evacuation warnings included several schools and the al-Shifa hospital, the Strip’s largest, according to a map published by the IDF.\nWitnesses and medics said shortly after the evacuation orders Israeli planes carried several airstrikes against targets within Gaza City.\nThe IDF had no immediate comment, and said it was trying to verify the reports.\nThe war in Gaza began with the Hamas assault on October 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages.\nOver 52,000 people have since been killed in the Strip, according to the Hamas health ministry’s unverifiable tally, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.",

    "headline": "Trump’s sanctions on ICC prosecutor said to have halted tribunal’s work",
    "subheading": "Key organizations paused cooperation with International Criminal Court, chief prosecutor Karim Khan lost email access; US measures response to arrest warrants issued for Israeli leaders",
    "date": "Updated 11:18 AM GMT+5:30, May 15, 2025",
    "article": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands — The International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor has lost access to his email, and his bank accounts have been frozen.\nThe Hague-based court’s American staffers have been told that if they travel to the US they risk arrest.\nSome non-governmental organizations have stopped working with the ICC and the leaders of one won’t even reply to emails from court officials.\nThose are just some of the hurdles facing court staff since US President Donald Trump in February slapped sanctions on its chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, according to interviews with current and former ICC officials, international lawyers and human rights advocates.\nThe sanctions will “prevent victims from getting access to justice,” warned Liz Evenson, international justice director at Human Rights Watch.\nTrump sanctioned the court after a panel of ICC judges in November issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his then-defense minister, Yoav Gallant. The US and Israel are not members of the court.\nJudges found there was reason to believe that the pair may have committed war crimes by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeting civilians in Israel’s campaign against the Hamas terror group in Gaza — charges Israeli officials deny.\nIsrael says it goes to great lengths to avoid harming civilians as it targets Hamas and other terror groups who have built a warren of fortified tunnels under Gaza and routinely use civilian infrastructure like schools and hospitals as command centers and to carry out attacks.\nStaffers and allies of the ICC said the sanctions have made it increasingly difficult for the tribunal to conduct basic tasks, let alone seek justice for victims of war crimes or genocide.\nA spokesperson for the ICC and for Khan declined to comment. In February, ICC President Judge Tomoko Akane said that the sanctions “constitute serious attacks against the Court’s States Parties, the rule of law based international order and millions of victims.”\nThe February order bans Khan and other non-Americans among the ICC’s 900 staff members from entering the United States. It also threatens any person, institution or company with fines and prison time if they provide Khan with “financial, material, or technological support.”\nThe sanctions are hampering work on a broad array of investigations, not just the one into Israel’s leaders.\nThe ICC, for example, had been investigating atrocities in Sudan and had issued arrest warrants for former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir on charges that include genocide. That probe has ground to a halt even as reports mount of new atrocities in Sudan, according to an attorney representing an ICC prosecutor who is fighting the sanctions in US courts. The prosecutor, Eric Iverson, filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking protection from the sanctions.\nHer client “cannot do, what I would describe as, basic lawyer functions,” said Allison Miller, who is representing Iverson in the suit.\nAmerican staffers at the organization, like Iverson, have been warned by its attorneys that they risk arrest if they return home to visit family, according to ICC officials. Six senior officials have left the court over concerns about sanctions.\nOne reason the court has been hamstrung is that it relies heavily on contractors and non-governmental organizations. Those businesses and groups have curtailed work on behalf of the court because they were concerned about being targeted by US authorities, according to current and former ICC staffers.\nMicrosoft, for example, cancelled Khan’s email address, forcing the prosecutor to move to Proton Mail, a Swiss email provider, ICC staffers said. His bank accounts in his home country of the United Kingdom have been blocked.\nMicrosoft did not respond to a request for comment.\nStaffers at a non-governmental organization that plays an integral role in the court’s efforts to gather evidence and find witnesses said the group has transferred money out of US bank accounts because they fear it might be seized by the Trump administration.\nSenior leadership at two other US-based human rights organizations told the AP that their groups have stopped working with the ICC. A senior staffer at one told the AP that employees have even stopped replying to emails from court officials out of fear of triggering a response from the Trump administration.\nThe cumulative effect of such actions has led ICC staffers to openly wonder whether the organization can survive the Trump administration, according to ICC officials who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal.\nSaid one such official: “It’s hard to see how the court makes it through the next four years.”\nTrump, a staunch supporter of Netanyahu, issued his sanctions order shortly after retaking office, accusing the ICC of “illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.” Washington says the court has no jurisdiction over Israel.\nTrump’s order said the ICC’s “actions against Israel and the United States set a dangerous precedent, directly endangering current and former United States personnel, including active service members of the Armed Forces.” He said the court’s “malign conduct” threatens “the sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States Government.”\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\nNetanyahu has dismissed the ICC’s allegations as “absurd,” and Israel’s Knesset is considering legislation that would make providing evidence to the court a crime.\nIsrael launched its offensive after Hamas-led terrorists stormed into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 as hostages to Gaza. Of those, 57, over half of whom are believed dead, are still in captivity, plus the body of a soldier held for the past decade.\nInside the court, staffers have been coping with dark humor, joking about how they cannot even loan Khan a pen or risk appearing on the US radar.\nThis is not the first time the ICC has drawn Trump’s ire. In 2020, the former Trump administration sanctioned Khan’s predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, and one of her deputies over the court’s investigation into alleged crimes committed in Afghanistan while the United States military was operating in the country.\nUS president Joe Biden rescinded the sanctions when he took office several months later.\nThree lawsuits are now pending from US court staff and consultants against the Trump administration, arguing that the sanctions infringe on their freedom of expression. Earlier this week Iverson, the lawyer investigating genocide in Sudan, won temporary protection from prosecution but if other US citizens at the court want a similar assurance, they would have to bring their own complaint.\nMeanwhile, the court is facing an increasing lack of cooperation from countries normally considered to be its staunchest supporters.\nThe ICC has no enforcement apparatus of its own and relies on member states. In the last year, three countries – including two in the European Union – have refused to execute warrants issued by the court.\nThe renewed assault from the Trump administration comes as the court was already facing internal challenges. Last year, just weeks before Khan announced he was requesting arrest warrants for the Israeli officials, two court staff reported the British barrister had harassed a female aide, according to reporting by the Associated Press.\nKhan has categorically denied the accusations that he groped and tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship. A United Nations investigation is underway, and Khan has since been accused of retaliating against staff who supported the woman, including demoting several people he felt were critical of him.",

    "date": "Updated 07:37 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "US special envoy Steve Witkoff and US hostage envoy Adam Boehler on Tuesday told families of hostages still in Gaza that they think there is a chance to make progress on freeing their loved ones as they head to Qatar for indirect talks between Israel and Hamas, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum said.\nThe Forum said that during a two-hour meeting, Witkoff “expressed that everyone would prefer to see a diplomatic solution, noting that most captivity survivors have been released through diplomatic means.”\n“He assured the families that if he and Boehler didn’t believe there was a genuine chance for progress in negotiations, they wouldn’t be making the trip to Doha,” the Forum added.\nWitkoff also insisted that Trump would be “relentless” in working to ensure that all remaining hostages come home, the Forum said.\nIn further remarks at the meeting broadcast on Tuesday evening on Channel 12 news, Witkoff said: “Everything is moving in the direction of: create a deal to diplomatically solve it. And if we can’t diplomatically solve it… it will be one of the worst failures that I can ever endure in my life.”\nAt another point in the discussion, the father of hostage Nimrod Cohen posed a question to Witkoff: “Why aren’t you forcing the Israeli government to stop the war? Because this is the only way it could end. For the good of everybody,” he asked in a recording obtained by Haaretz.\n“I don’t want to get into it,” Witkoff responded. “We’re not the Israeli government. We don’t disagree. The Israeli government is a sovereign government. They can’t tell us what to do, and we can’t tell them what to do.”\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to end the war in exchange for all of the hostages, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power. He appears to be out of step with the majority of Israelis who back such an exchange, according to repeated polls.\nThe meeting between Witkoff and hostage families came ahead of another round of negotiations in Doha that was slated to start on Wednesday. Netanyahu said Israel may agree to a short-term truce, but will not end the war in Gaza until Hamas is defeated, his office said Tuesday.\n“Eliminating Hamas and freeing all our hostages — these go hand in hand. That’s how we’re doing this,” Netanyahu said Monday night in a meeting with injured reservists from the group “Wounded Soldiers for Victory,” according to a video shared by his office. The premier also told the soldiers that Israel was gearing up to take control of the Strip and was looking for countries to take in Gazans.\nThe premier has stressed that negotiations would be conducted with Gaza “under fire” — despite a reported US commitment to the contrary — and that the military’s planned offensive to achieve control of the entire Strip will still go ahead if Hamas does not release more captives first.\nThe negotiations were jump-started by the release on Monday of US-Israeli captive soldier Edan Alexander following indirect talks between Witkoff and Hamas, in which the White House reportedly agreed to the terror group’s request that the US pressure Israel into a ceasefire-hostage deal.\nHamas on Tuesday said Netanyahu was “misleading” the public by calling Alexander’s release the result of Israeli military pressure. The terror group said the release was “the result of serious communications with the US administration and the efforts of mediators.”\nAlexander’s release was widely seen as a goodwill gesture to US President Donald Trump, who is due in Doha on Wednesday as part of a state visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The soldier was the last known living US citizen in Hamas captivity, and his release was seen as a goodwill gesture to Trump.\nIn the wake of Alexander’s release, terror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 58 hostages, including 57 of those abducted on October 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages, sparking the war in Gaza.\nAlexander and 23 other young men still thought to be alive had been set for release in the second phase of a ceasefire-hostage deal that was struck in January following mediation by Egypt, the US and Qatar. However, the deal’s 42-day first phase expired on March 2 amid Netanyahu’s refusal to negotiate the second phase, which would have required a full IDF withdrawal from Gaza — a red line for his far-right coalition partners.\nNetanyahu at the time demanded Hamas agree to “Witkoff’s framework,” which would have extended the first phase of the ceasefire by some 40 days in return for about half the remaining living hostages. On Monday, as negotiations were set to resume, the premier reportedly told coalition partners that Israel was still committed to the framework, saying the war would continue until Hamas is vanquished.\nWitkoff and Boehler, who on Tuesday visited Alexander at Tel Aviv’s Ichilov Hospital, later told members of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum that Trump remained committed to bringing home all the remaining captives.\n“The president’s not going to tolerate anything other than everybody coming home, and he will be relentless on that pursuit… when people don’t do so well with the United States, we don’t do so well with them,” said Witkoff at the Forum’s Tel Aviv headquarters, according to video released by the group.\nAccording to Channel 12 news, a “small” delegation of hostages’ relatives was also headed to Doha and would meet with both Trump and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman al-Thani. The report did not specify the exact makeup of the delegation, but said the group would be led by Eytan Stibbe, a former fighter pilot, arms dealer and businessman who was part of a private trip to space in 2022.\nAl-Thani, whose country backs Hamas and hosts its politburo, suggested to Trump and Witkoff during a visit to Washington last month that they accept a Hamas-approved proposal to release all the hostages and end the war in Gaza, but was told Washington would accept only a temporary, phased deal, Axios reported Tuesday.\nUpon returning to Doha, al-Thani encouraged Hamas to make a gesture to Trump to change the US president’s position, according to the report. Shortly afterward, Hamas reached out to Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian-American businessman and Trump supporter, to mediate talks with the US on the proposal, the report said, citing four Israeli, Palestinian and US officials. The existence of this backchannel was first reported by The Times of Israel.\nThe White House subsequently told the terror group that if Alexander were released, the US would pressure Israel to implement a 70- to 90-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of 10 hostages, during which negotiations for a final deal would be held, according to a Palestinian official cited by in the report.\nThe US, Qatar and Egypt would ensure that the war wouldn’t resume throughout the talks, the official added, though the US did not confirm this to Axios.\nFor his part, Trump did not pressure Netanyahu during their phone call Monday to roll back his plans for an expanded ground campaign in Gaza set to begin after Trump’s Middle East visit, Israeli officials told Axios.\nSpeaking to the wounded reservists Monday night, Netanyahu said “the situation has changed,” and vowed that “in the coming days, we’ll go in with full force to complete the operation.”\n“Completing the operation means subduing Hamas. It means destroying Hamas,” he said.\n“Maybe Hamas will say, ‘Wait — we want to release ten more,’” added Netanyahu. “Fine, bring them. We’ll take them. And then we’ll go in. But there will be no situation where we stop the war.”\n“A temporary ceasefire — fine. But we’re going all the way,” he said.\nNetanyahu also said Israel was gearing up to let Gazans emigrate, in keeping with a plan announced by Trump in February to take over the devastated Strip, oust its residents and rebuild it as a coastal resort.\n“We’ve already set up a governing body that will allow [civilians] to exit, but the main issue is this — we need host countries willing to absorb them,” said Netanyahu. “That’s what we’re working on right now.”\n“If we give them a way out, I’m telling you — more than 50% will leave. In my opinion, many more,” he said, assuring the soldiers that, in any case, “Hamas will not remain.”\nThe premier said the “Wounded Soldiers for Victory” reservists, who oppose a ceasefire in Gaza, are “an inspiration, and with your spirit, we are heading toward a total victory.” The reservists, meanwhile, “expressed support for Netanyahu’s leadership in pursuing victory and achieving all the war’s objectives, and urged him to decisively defeat the terrorist organization Hamas,” the premier’s office said.\nAFP contributed to this report.",

    "article": "Sixty-one percent of Israelis support normalizing ties with Saudi Arabia and expanding the Abraham Accords in 2025, according to a poll published Tuesday, coinciding with US President Donald Trump’s first Middle East tour.\nThe survey, conducted by Ipanel on behalf of the Coalition for Regional Security, found that just 4.7% of respondents opposed Saudi normalization, while 33.9% said they neither support nor oppose such a move.\nThe survey measured Israeli public attitudes on regional diplomacy, the war in Gaza, and a potential US-led initiative based on a representative sample of 954 Israeli adults, including both Jews and Arabs.\nThe poll was released as Trump began a four-day trip to the Middle East, kicking off in Saudi Arabia before continuing to the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Speaking at an investment summit in Riyadh, the president said Tuesday that it is his “dream” for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, though he acknowledged that Riyadh would do so in its own time.\n“It’s my fervent hope, wish and even my dream that Saudi Arabia… will soon be joining the Abraham Accords,” he said.\nThe poll suggests that many Israelis share that sentiment. When asked whether normalization with Saudi Arabia would strengthen Israel’s security, economy and regional standing, and weaken Iran, 67% of respondents said it would contribute significantly. Another 16% said it would contribute little or not at all, while 17.1% said they didn’t know.\nSupport for normalization was also consistent across political lines. Among Israelis who voted for the parties in the government coalition, 60% said they support normalization (compared to 61% of all respondents), and 65% said it would contribute significantly to Israel’s strategic interests (compared to 67% overall).\nThe poll also addressed the impact of Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza on ties with Saudi Arabia and beyond. A majority — 53% — said that occupying and controlling the Gaza Strip would somewhat or greatly harm the chances of reaching an agreement with Saudi Arabia and cooperating with moderate countries in the region. Just 12.8% said it would not harm those efforts, while 34.3% said it would neither help nor hinder them.\nA substantial majority — 68.9% — said they would back a Trump-led regional political initiative that included the return of all Israeli hostages, an end to the war in Gaza, normalization with Saudi Arabia, a pathway toward separation from the Palestinians, and the formation of a US-led regional security coalition against Iran. Only 9.7% said no, while 21.5% were neutral.\nUpon publication of the poll, the Coalition for Regional Security — a group of over 100 senior Israeli figures from the military, political, business, and academic sectors — called on the government to act quickly.\n“This survey serves as an urgent wake-up call to the Israeli government: enough with political intransigence — get on board the regional train now,” the group said in a statement.\n“This is the moment to seize the historic opportunity presented by President Trump to reshape the Middle East and strengthen Israel’s security. History will not forgive those who miss the chance to bring regional stability through strategic alliances and courageous partnerships that are forming at this very moment. The Israeli people want this — now the government must say ‘yes’ to President Trump. If we keep hesitating — we will be left behind.”\nDuring his visit in Riyadh, Trump signed a host of economic and bilateral cooperation agreements with Saudi Arabia.\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto Saudi ruler, has already committed to some $600 billion in new Saudi investment in the US, but Trump teased that $1 trillion would be even better. The agreements included a mammoth arms deal described by the White House as the largest “in history” between the allies, worth nearly $142 billion.\nTrump also announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria’s new government, after being pressed by bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nThe US president will next travel to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in his first Middle East tour, notably skipping Israel.",

    "subheading": "Netanyahu reportedly says that unless Hamas agrees to disarm, Israel will accept only a temporary truce that frees some of the hostages; meeting wounded soldiers, PM said to predict ‘things you’ve never seen’ in Gaza",
    "date": "Updated 08:19 AM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a call with coalition party chiefs on Monday, reportedly trying to assure them that Israel wasn’t going to agree to end the war before Hamas is defeated after he agreed to a request from the Trump administration to send a negotiating team to Doha in order to jumpstart long-stalled hostage negotiations with the terror group.\nNetanyahu agreed to the US request after meeting with US special envoy to the Mideast Steve Witkoff and holding a brief phone call with President Donald Trump after Hamas released American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander from 584 days in captivity. Hamas released Alexander in what has been characterized as a gesture of goodwill to Trump after the group received assurances from a third-party mediator that the step would go a long way with Washington, opening the door to the administration potentially coaxing Israel to end the war in Gaza.\nBut Netanyahu told coalition partners that he won’t budge from his refusal to end the war before Hamas’s military and governing capabilities have been completely dismantled, according to multiple Hebrew media reports.\nThis could put him at odds with not just Hamas, but also the United States, whose officials for the first time in months are employing rhetoric about “ending the war” in Gaza, as Israel threatens to massively expand its military operations in order to re-occupy the entire Strip.\nTrump characterized Hamas’s decision to release Alexander as a “step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators… to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.”\nHis ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee expressed the administration’s hope that Alexander’s release “marks the beginning of the end to this terrible war,” which was sparked over 19 months ago by Hamas when its terrorists invaded Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 253 hostage. Fifty-eight people are still being held in Gaza — at least 23 of whom are believed to be alive.\nOver 52,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the Gaza war, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures have not been credibly verified and don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants. On March 2, Israel began blocking humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, arguing that enough had gone in during a six-week ceasefire and asserting that Hamas has been stealing that assistance from civilians. But even IDF officials have acknowledged privately in recent weeks that the Strip is on the brink of starvation, and an Israeli plan to resume assistance faces mounting obstacles.\nWhile repeated polls have indicated that a clear majority of Israelis back ending the war in exchange for the hostages, Netanyahu has rejected this trade, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power. His far-right coalition partners have also threatened to collapse his government if he were to approve such an agreement.\nAll of this raises the stakes as an Israeli delegation takes off for Doha on Tuesday for another round of indirect talks with Hamas co-mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the US. The Israeli officials Netanyahu is sending to Doha are his diplomatic adviser Ophir Falk, the government’s hostage point man Gal Hirsch and a former Shin Bet deputy chief — whose name is barred from publication.\nTrump will also arrive in the region on Tuesday, starting in Saudi Arabia before continuing to Qatar and then the United Arab Emirates — with the Gaza war likely to come up during his meetings with Gulf leaders, even if the issue is not expected to dominate a trip largely focusing on US economic interests in the region.\nIsrael has threatened to launch its major military operation in Gaza once Trump leaves the Mideast on Friday if Hamas doesn’t agree to a hostage deal by then.\nNetanyahu told his coalition partners in his call on Monday that despite sending a negotiating team to Doha, his position hasn’t changed. The negotiators only have a mandate to discuss what the premier has referred to as the “Witkoff proposal,” which would see as many as half of the hostages released in exchange for a weekslong ceasefire. During that truce, Israel is prepared to hold talks regarding a permanent end to the war, but will accept nothing less than Hamas agreeing to disarm and give up governing control of Gaza.\nHamas has said it is prepared to cede control of the Strip and agree to a yearslong truce with Israel that includes security guarantees. However, it has long refused demands that it permanently disarm.\nIt has also demanded guarantees from the mediators — potentially in the form of a binding UN Security Council resolution — that Israel be prevented from resuming the war if Hamas agrees to release hostages. Arab mediators say they face an uphill battle convincing Hamas to release hostages without assurances that Israel will end the war because the previous deal signed in January was supposed to see the sides enter talks regarding the terms of a permanent ceasefire, but Netanyahu largely refused to do so and the truce collapsed in March after its first of three phases.\nNetanyahu, in his Monday call with coalition heads, said Israel would not accept any guarantees that it end the war absent the complete dismantlement of Hamas.\nThe US has backed this goal in the past, and Arab stakeholders are principally supportive, but they have argued that it will be a gradual process that requires Israel allowing for a viable alternative to be stood up in Gaza, with the foundation being a reformed Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu has refused to grant the PA a significant foothold in Gaza. The stance has stopped nearly half a dozen Arab countries from taking part in the post-war management of the Strip, given that they’ve conditioned their support on the establishment of a political horizon for an eventual two-state solution.\nAmid the lack of alternatives to Hamas, the war in Gaza has dragged on, as Hamas has managed to continue recruiting fighters, frequently returning to areas briefly cleared by the IDF. After asserting during the war’s initial months that Israel did not seek to re-occupy Gaza, such a result is seen as increasingly likely, and Netanyahu and his coalition partners are now openly framing it as their goal.\nIn a meeting with wounded IDF soldiers on Monday evening, Netanyahu said that “within days, things are going to happen in Gaza… that you have never seen before until now,” according to Hebrew media reports.\nThe meeting was held with the hawkish forum “Wounded Soldiers for Victory,” which was established about two weeks ago with the aim of promoting the “destruction of Hamas,” according to a Ynet report.\nIn the hour-and-a-half-long meeting, Netanyahu listened to the soldiers’ accounts of their combat injuries and said to them that, while he is “giving a chance” for the return of the hostages, if these efforts do not succeed, the fighting will be intense and “to the end,” says Ynet.\nNetanyahu was also quoted as having said that Israel will “occupy” Gaza and will take over security control over Gaza “forever.”\nLast week, Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel claimed on CNN that those calling for Israel to occupy Gaza are part of a fringe and don’t represent the position of the Israeli government.\nDuring closed-door testimony before the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Tuesday, Netanyahu said that Israel is “destroying more and more houses [in Gaza and Palestinians accordingly] have nowhere to return,” according to quotes leaked to the Maariv daily.\n“The only obvious result will be Gazans choosing to emigrate outside of the Strip,” Netanyahu continued. “But our main problem is finding countries to take them in.”\nNetanyahu told the lawmakers that he had recently discussed Trump’s plan for the US to take over Gaza with the president but acknowledged that there have been difficulties in implementing it.\nWhile Trump initially called on Egypt and Jordan to take in Palestinians, both countries quickly pushed back against the idea, insisting that Palestinians should be allowed to remain on their land.\nIsrael has also refrained from publicly assuring Gazans that those who leave will be allowed to return, further reducing the incentive for countries to take in Gazans, given the perception that they’d be interfering in a decades-old land conflict.\nDozens who have left Gaza as part of a pilot program offering them work abroad were reportedly required to sign documents upon departure acknowledging that there is no timeline for when they can come back due to the security situation. Children who have been evacuated for medical treatment abroad have also been prevented by Israel from reuniting with their families back in Gaza after the completion of their hospital stay.\nDuring Sunday’s Knesset committee meeting, Netanyahu claimed that despite the lack of success in finding countries to take in Gazans, the US is still interested in taking over Gaza.\nSources familiar with the matter have told The Times of Israel, however, that the Trump administration has put minimal effort into actually advancing Trump’s Gaza takeover plan, following the massive pushback it received from Arab allies since it was announced in early February.\nStill, Netanyahu told the lawmakers. “I know I will disappoint some people here, but we are not talking about Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip right now.”\nMK Limor Son Har-Melech replied, “Bring the Jews of the United States (to settle Gaza). That way, we can kill two birds with one stone,” according to Maariv.\nNetanyahu also briefed the committee on Israel’s plan to soon resume the distribution of aid in Gaza through a new system that aims to prevent assistance from being diverted by Hamas.\nNetanyahu said that those who pick up aid from newly established distribution hubs in southern Gaza will be barred from returning to places in Gaza outside of the new humanitarian zone being set up in southern Gaza. Israel’s aid plan envisions squeezing Gaza’s entire population of 2 million people into an area in and surrounding Rafah that makes up between 10 and 25 percent of the Strip. Those entering will be vetted by the IDF, according to officials briefed on the plan.\nA new organization called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation was established in order to manage the new aid program. GHF was supposed to announce its rollout last week, but has faced major setbacks after the UAE, the UN and other international bodies refused to cooperate or fund the initiative due to concerns that it doesn’t adequately address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where aid has been banned by Israel since March 2.",

    "article": "An earlier version of this Editor’s Note was sent out Wednesday in ToI’s weekly update email to members of the Times of Israel Community. To receive these Editor’s Notes as they’re released, join the ToI Community here.\nNobody had doubted US Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff’s immense personal commitment to securing the release of all the hostages from Hamas captivity in Gaza.\nBut he has proved it multiple times in the past few days. He oversaw the indirect contacts with Hamas that secured the release of the last living hostage with American citizenship, 21-year-old IDF soldier Edan Alexander. He flew to Israel to greet Alexander on his release on Monday, went to visit him and his family in the hospital on Tuesday, and put him on the phone with US President Donald Trump in Riyadh and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nExtraordinarily, he gave Alexander the Star of David necklace that his own son Andrew used to wear before his tragic death in 2011 and that he has reportedly worn himself ever since, and told the freed hostage that he “would be doing a great honor to my son if you keep wearing this.”\nHe and Trump’s hostages envoy Adam Boehler then spent over an hour and a half meeting with families of the remaining 58 hostages still held by Hamas, reiterating the Trump administration’s commitment to getting them all freed. Relative after relative emerged from the meeting with a little of their 586 days of agony eased. “It was a calming meeting,” Meirav Gilboa-Dalal, whose son Guy is among the living hostages, said on Wednesday morning. “We met a man who understands our pain.”\nIn an audio clip from the meeting, Witkoff can be heard saying that if he cannot facilitate a diplomatic solution to the hostage crisis, “it will be one of the worst failures that I can ever endure in my life.”\nWitkoff is in Doha right now attempting to arrange precisely such a solution, on behalf of a president who keeps restating that the US is determined to secure the release of all the hostages. Netanyahu has dispatched a delegation, too, but reportedly with little room for maneuver in negotiations. The prime minister said on Tuesday that were Hamas to offer “to release 10 more” living hostages, that would be “fine. We’ll take them… But there will be no situation where we stop the war.\n“A temporary ceasefire — fine. But we’re going all the way,” he stressed. “In the coming days, we’ll go in with full force to complete the operation. Completing the operation means subduing Hamas. It means destroying Hamas.”\nWitkoff on Tuesday hailed Netanyahu’s crucial role in the process that enabled Alexander’s release, assuring the prime minister in a phone conversation that the way he “allowed the negotiations to operate” was “in large part the reason that Edan is home with his family today.” And while Trump has been saying he is working to get the Gaza war ended “as quickly as possible,” he has reportedly not been directly pressing Netanyahu to do so in order to secure the freedom of the remaining hostages — a Hamas condition that Netanyahu has repeatedly made clear he will not accept, because it would mean Hamas surviving, rebuilding, and preparing to attack again.\nBut the US president, as he is proving almost minute by minute in his current fast-paced Middle East trip, is an insistent deal-maker. And whether he’s still broadly empathetic to Netanyahu’s concerns or not particularly bothered by some of them, he’s moving ahead on a whole range of vital regional issues without including Israel on his regional itinerary, without arranging for an Israeli presence at his critical meetings, and without heeding Israeli concerns in an expanding number of his agreements.\nBefore setting out on his trip, Trump signed a truce with the Houthis two days after they launched a missile that struck Ben Gurion Airport, prompting foreign airlines to flee.\nHe dramatically deepened US-Saudi relations, with Israel out of the loop — telling Saudi leaders on Tuesday that while it is his dream for them to join the Abraham Accords with Israel, “you’ll do it in your own time.” Left unspoken was his recognition that Saudi Arabia will not normalize ties with an Israeli government, under Netanyahu, that refuses to set out even a theoretical pathway to Palestinian statehood.\nHe signed an unprecedentedly large arms deal with Riyadh, worth some $142 billion, doubtless to Jerusalem’s dismay (especially if Israel’s air supremacy is undermined). And he is reportedly discussing a deal regarding the Saudis’ desire for a civil nuclear program, which opposition leader Yair Lapid warned on Wednesday would trigger a Middle East nuclear race.\nHe is determined to seal a deal with Iran that, given the US zig-zagging on whether this will require the destruction of all of the regime’s nuclear facilities, has Jerusalem in panic mode.\nOver objections from Jerusalem, he’s lifted all sanctions on a Syrian leadership that Israel understandably regards as a terrorist regime unless or until proven otherwise, and asked President Ahmed al-Sharaa to normalize relations with Israel and join the Abraham Accords.\nAs I write, he’s just arrived in Qatar, the Hamas-funding, Hamas-hosting mediator that’s allegedly been paying some of Netanyahu’s aides to lobby on its behalf, and that Trump has insisted is “absolutely trying to help” resolve the hostage-war crisis.\nEvery one of these moves has vast implications for Israeli security, economy and the daily well-being of its people. Any Israeli government would have tried to influence and amend Trump’s rapid deal-making steps toward the Houthis, the Syrians, the Saudis and the Iranians. But Israel has been largely marginalized as Trump has advanced them.\nIt was being speculated in Jerusalem on Tuesday evening that Trump is angry with Netanyahu for having sought to push him toward a military strike on Iran, when he has been advocating diplomacy. It was also being suggested that Trump has concluded that Israel is simply no longer as central to American interests in the region.\nOpposition leader Lapid argued that Netanyahu had denied Israel a seat in Riyadh because of the far-right-driven policies of his coalition. “Netanyahu had two options,” said Lapid on Wednesday afternoon. “Either to do something in Khan Younis for the sixth time, or to be in Riyadh — to sit at the head of a table in Saudi Arabia and be part of agreements on a scale we’ve never known, bringing historic change to the Middle East. And he chose a military operation in Khan Younis” — targeting Hamas’s Gaza leader Mohammad Sinwar.\n“I’m in favor of eliminating the leaders of Hamas,” Lapid went on, referring to Tuesday’s IDF strike, “but for the national interest, we had to be in Saudi Arabia. And we’re not in Saudi Arabia because [Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners Bezalel] Smotrich and [Itamar] Ben Gvir won’t allow it. (The two party leaders insisted on March’s return to war in Gaza, after only the first of the three envisaged phases of the hostage-ceasefire deal finalized by Witkoff in January, and they are even more adamant than Netanyahu in their opposition to any notion of Palestinian statehood.) Said Lapid: “This is causing harm for generations and harm to our relations with the Americans.”\nFor now, with Trump and Netanyahu’s Israel, it appears to be less a case of “he’s not that into you,” and more a case of “I’m moving ahead, with or without you.” With this trip, Trump is soaringly elevating the Gulf states, and that, by definition, means Israel’s regional importance is reduced in the president’s considerations.\n“The transformation that has occurred under the leadership of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed [Bin Salman] has been truly extraordinary,” the president enthused of Saudi Arabia in his main address on Tuesday night, calling the crown prince the US’s strongest partner. “We have great partners in the world, but we have none stronger and nobody like the gentleman that’s right before me,” Trump said of Bin Salman, looking at the crown prince. “He’s your greatest representative… I like him too much… Great guy.”\nImplicit in Trump’s admiration for progress in the Gulf is a demotion of Israel as the go-to regional cutting-edge powerhouse, the prime innovator, the tech pioneer, the smart destination for investment. Right now, you can barely even fly here.\nIt is not clear how all this will affect Steve Witkoff’s efforts in Doha. Gilboa-Delal said Wednesday that the envoy told the families the US can’t decide for Israel on the terms it will accept to bring back hostages. But the US president has untold military, diplomatic and economic leverage he can bring to bear should he choose to.\nThe fact is that Trump is forging ahead with a whole slew of deals and alliances radically impacting Israel — and in so doing, he is already determining core aspects of Israel’s security and geopolitical future.\nHe said on the plane to Qatar that the US having good ties with the Gulf states “is very good for Israel.” Potentially, that is true, but only if the Israeli leadership proves capable of utilizing those ties. The longer Israel is not seated at the main table alongside the US president, metaphorically and literally, the narrower Israel’s room for maneuver.",

    "date": "Updated 03:44 PM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "US President Donald Trump told Gulf leaders on Wednesday that he urgently wants “to make a deal” with Iran to wind down its nuclear program, but that Tehran must end its support of proxy groups throughout the region as part of any potential agreement.\nIran “must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars, and permanently and verifiably cease pursuit of nuclear weapons,” Trump said in remarks at a meeting of leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council hosted by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh. “They cannot have a nuclear weapon.”\nThe US and Iran have engaged in four rounds of talks since early last month, focused on Iran’s nuclear program. Trump has repeatedly said he believes brokering a deal is possible, but that the window is closing.\nThe president’s strongly worded push on Iran to cease support of Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen comes after its proxy network suffered significant setbacks in the 19 months since Hamas launched its devastating October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, triggering war in the Gaza Strip.\nIn Iran, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called Trump’s remarks “deceitful” but did not directly address the US leader’s call on Iran to cease support of proxy groups.\n“What he stated about willing of the regional nations for a progressive, flourishing path, is the same path that people of Iran decided through their revolution, indeed, for having a fully independent, democratic, free, wealthy and advanced country,” Araghchi said.\nBoth Hezbollah and the Houthis attacked Israel with rockets and drones in support of Gaza shortly after the October 7 onslaught. The fighting with Hezbollah escalated into open war in September, which ended with a ceasefire last November after Israel decimated the terror group’s leadership and resources.\nThe Houthis are still firing at Israel and though most missiles and drones have been thwarted by air defense systems — including a missile on Wednesday morning — some have slipped through, killing a person in Tel Aviv and causing damage on other occasions. Last week, a missile hit within the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, prompting international carriers to halt flights to Israel. Retaliatory Israeli airstrikes have destroyed significant Houthi-controlled infrastructure in Yemen.\nTrump in March ordered the US to carry out intensive strikes on the Houthis, citing the group’s attacks on shipping in the Red Sea as part of its campaign against Israel, disrupting a vital global sea route. Earlier this month, he announced a ceasefire agreement had been reached under which the Houthis agreed to no longer attack US Navy or American ships in the Red Sea, though they said they would continue attacking Israel.\nIn Riyadh, Trump also said that he believed the moment was ripe “for a [Lebanese] future free from the grip of Hezbollah terrorists.” The terror group is severely weakened after its war with Israel, in which much of its top leadership was killed, and after losing a key ally with the fall of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, whose country had served as a conduit for Iran to send arms.",

    "date": "Updated 11:49 PM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "Freed hostage Edan Alexander’s conditions in captivity improved following the inauguration of US President Donald Trump in January, according to a family member.\nAlexander’s aunt, Sharon Senyor, told the Ynet news site on Wednesday that “he said that since Trump took power his conditions improved. From the moment they started to talk about him, they gave him more food so that he would gain weight.”\nYnet also reported, citing conversations Alexander had with others since his release on Monday, that following Trump’s inauguration, the freed hostage was moved to a “VIP tunnel” with senior Hamas officials in order to both serve as a human shield and provide him with further protection due to his American citizenship.\nThis echoes comments Alexander reportedly made during his phone conversation with Trump on Tuesday. According to Channel 12 news, Alexander, when asked by the US president how Hamas had treated him, answered: “Since you got elected, my conditions improved dramatically. There are tons of cameras and people around me right now — I can’t share much at the moment. We’ll talk in private.”\nAlthough reports had circulated that Alexander might fly to Doha on Wednesday to meet with Trump, his family said following his release that he required further medical treatment before leaving the country, and expects to meet the US president in Washington in the future.\nAlexander, 21, the last living hostage with American citizenship, was freed from Gaza on Monday, after 584 days in captivity, following indirect talks between the US and Hamas. The negotiations sidelined Israeli officials, who were updated only after the deal was struck.\nA dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, Alexander was serving in the IDF’s Golani Brigade at the time of his abduction. Hamas kidnapped him from his base near the Gaza border community of Nirim, known as the White House post, during its October 7 onslaught.\nHe is the first male IDF soldier to be freed by Hamas since the start of the war. The other hostages with US citizenship still remaining in the Strip have all been declared dead by Israeli officials — soldiers Itay Chen and Omer Neutra and married couple Judith Weinstein and Gadi Haggai.\nTrump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, pressed heavily on Hamas and Israel to agree to a January ceasefire that went into effect even before Trump took office. Pressure and threats from Trump are considered to have played a significant role in ultimately bringing the deal to fruition after more than a year of stalled talks.\nDuring that deal, Hamas freed 30 hostages, including five Thai nationals, and returned the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives. Two of those freed, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Keith Siegel, also had US citizenship, and Siegel met with Trump in the White House in March.\nIn March, Hamas offered to free only Alexander and the bodies of the other hostages with US citizenship, a move rejected by Israel and later also rejected by Witkoff.\nAlexander told soldiers who received him in the Strip that Hamas subjected him to harsh torture for weeks on end and kept him in a cage over a long period of time with his hands and feet bound, the Kan public broadcaster reported.\nIn remarks to reporters on Tuesday evening, his parents, Yael and Adi, spoke of Edan’s suffering during more than 19 months of captivity.\nYael said her son suffered from a lack of water, food and other aid. He also described the terror he experienced when the IDF would strike Gaza, destroying buildings.\n“The strikes and bombs made him think that every moment was about to be his last one,” she said. “Edan, my hero, you returned from the horror. But other hostages are still living through that threat, they are still living in that hell. My heart has returned to beating, but they still need to return home.”\nAccording to the Channel 12 news network, Alexander was severely beaten during the early period of his captivity, and he returned to Israel with flea bites and bruises all over his body.\nIsrael believes that 58 hostages are still being held by terror groups in Gaza, including 35 confirmed dead by Israeli authorities and another three about whom Israel has expressed severe concern. The 35 bodies include that of an IDF soldier who was killed in 2014.",

    "article": "On Tuesday afternoon, Israeli forces launched a wave of airstrikes on underground infrastructure near the European Hospital in Khan Younis, sending plumes of gray smoke into the sky above southern Gaza.\nIsraeli security officials say the massive bombardment was aimed at Muhammad Sinwar, thought to be the de facto leader of the Hamas terror group in Gaza.\nSinwar assumed leadership of Hamas’s military wing following the July assassination of its previous leader Mohammed Deif, and later emerged as the group’s top commander in the Strip after his older brother Yahya Sinwar, who had been Hamas’s leader and orchestrated Hamas’s October 7, 2023 invasion and massacre in southern Israel, was killed by Israeli forces in late October.\nAccording to Hamas-run Gaza health authorities, at least 16 people were killed and over 70 were wounded in the Tuesday strikes as air force jets dropped dozens of bombs around the hospital. As of Wednesday afternoon, it was uncertain if Sinwar was among them.\nIsraeli intelligence believes Sinwar was inside the targeted tunnels at the time of the attack.\nAccording to security sources, if he was inside, he was likely killed due to the force of the strike, but confirmation is still pending.\nEven if he was killed, though, it remains unclear how much of an impact his assassination would have on the terror group, whose senior leadership largely lives outside the Gaza Strip.\nIsraeli officials have described Sinwar as obstinate with regard to negotiations with Hamas for the release of hostages, and an obstacle to reaching a ceasefire deal. But unlike his brother, who had wielded considerable influence over the direction of talks and the group’s strategic planning, it seems Muhammad Sinwar had only a limited role in either.\nThe younger Sinwar’s death might be felt keenly inside Hamas’s armed wing, where it would deepen a leadership vacuum, with most of the group’s top figures living abroad since the war began with the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack, in which thousands of terrorists killed some 1,200 people and abducted 251.\nThere are two potential successors who can replace him in managing Hamas’s military wing and attempting to rebuild it during the ongoing war.\nThe first is Izz ad-Din Haddad, commander of Hamas’s Gaza City Brigade, who is a longtime fixture within the senior echelons of Hamas’s armed wing. During the war, Haddad was promoted to oversee the entire Gaza Strip.\nHaddad rarely appears in public, but in May 2022 was seen in a video threatening Israel. In January, he went on Al-Jazeera and disclosed his role in planning the October 7 massacre. His face was blurred for the interview.\nAnother candidate is Mohammad Shabana, commander of the Rafah Brigade, who has risen through the ranks over the years. He reportedly survived an Israeli airstrike in May 2024 targeting a tunnel in Rafah. In March 2025, his wife and five children were killed in an Israeli strike.\nLike Haddad, Shabana is relatively unknown in Gaza and has not appeared in public during the war.\nBoth are veteran Hamas fighters who could help the organization continue its operations against Israel and even recover some strength.\nBut neither would likely have significant influence over Hamas’s strategic decision-making process, similar to the limited role played by Muhammad Sinwar.\nWhile Yahya Sinwar was a central Hamas figure with sway over ceasefire negotiations and final say over hostage deals, there is little evidence that his little brother has held a comparable position.\nYahya Sinwar was elected by Hamas members as the group’s Gaza leader in 2017 and officially appointed by the senior members of Hamas as the movement’s overall chief in August 2024. In contrast, Muhammad Sinwar has never been part of the political bureau.\nDespite operating while in hiding inside Gaza, unlike the rest of the group’s Qatar-based senior leadership, Yahya Sinwar was reportedly given final say in indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel that largely took place in Cairo.\nIsraeli sources indicated that the need to consult with Sinwar for Hamas’s answer in talks led to significant delays, with an elaborate system of mediators used to convey messages back and forth, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n“We’ll have to wait for Yahya Sinwar’s reply from the tunnels on every comma and detail of the negotiation,” one Israeli defense source was quoted complaining in March 2024, according to Channel 12 news.\nNone of this occurred once Muhammad Sinwar took over. Recent negotiations have been conducted with Hamas’s political leadership outside Gaza, and there have been no reports of delays due to a need to wait for Mohammad Sinwar’s input. Even the indirect channel between Hamas and the United States that led to the release of hostage soldier Edan Alexander on Monday was conducted via senior Hamas officials in Qatar.\nThough Muhammad Sinwar was considered Hamas’s de facto chief, officially the group is run by a five-member leadership council.\nAll members are senior figures from the political wing with no direct involvement in military operations. All reside outside Gaza — some have been abroad for years, while others left the Strip shortly before the war began.\nThe council includes Hamas spokesman Khalil al-Hayya, who is its top man for Gaza, though he likely wields little sway inside the Strip from his Gulf perch.\nThe remaining council members are Khaled Mashaal, Hamas leader abroad; Zaher Jabarin, head of Hamas in the West Bank; Mohammad Darwish, head of Hamas’s Shura Council, who is responsible for long-term strategic decisions; and Nizar Awadallah, a member of Hamas’s political bureau.\nOperating from deep underground in Gaza, in limited contact with the group’s senior leadership and holding little experience outside of military affairs, it’s tough to see how Muhammad Sinwar could have been a decisive voice on the ceasefire issue.\nWhile Hamas’s armed wing has leverage in any hostage deal due to its direct custody of those it abducted from Israel on October 7, its influence over broader strategic decisions is limited.\nShould Sinwar’s death be confirmed, it will almost certainly have no impact on the group’s positions or demands in hostage and ceasefire negotiations, which will continue to be determined by the leadership outside of Gaza. The deepest impact, therefore, might simply be that the sides will no longer have him to blame for their inability to make progress on freeing the hostages and ending the war.",

    "article": "Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Muhammad Sinwar, was targeted in a massive Israeli airstrike at a hospital in the southern Gaza Strip on Tuesday afternoon, security sources said.\nThe Israel Defense Forces, which did not confirm if Sinwar was killed, said in a statement that it had targeted Hamas operatives at an underground command center belonging to the terror group, below the European Hospital in Khan Younis. The military also released footage from the aftermath of the strike. The video purported to show that the IDF strike had uncovered the tunnel under the hospital, though the footage showed an adjacent school and not the medical center.\nFootage posted online showed several large plumes of smoke rising from the ground around the hospital, as Israeli Air Force fighter jets dropped dozens of heavy bombs. Other clips showed that the ground had collapsed in the area of the strike.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry reported 16 dead and over 70 wounded in the strike, though there was no immediate word if Sinwar was among the casualties.\nHours after the strike, three rockets were launched from northern Gaza to the area of Ashkelon and Sderot in southern Israel, the military said, adding that it had intercepted two rockets and the third fell in an open area. There were no injuries in the attack, which was claimed by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group.\nFollowing the attack, the IDF issued an evacuation warning for Palestinians in northern Gaza’s Jabalia. Writing on X, the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesman, Col. Avichay Adraee, published a map of the area to be evacuated, saying it was a “final warning” before the IDF carries out strikes there.\nצה\"ל ושב\"כ השמידו תשתית טרור תת-קרקעית של ארגון הטרור חמאס מתחת לבית החולים האירופאי שבחאן יונס שבדרום רצועת עזה\nמתחילת המלחמה, צה\"ל ושב\"כ פועלים להשמדה ונטרול של תשתיות תת-קרקע של ארגון הטרור חמאס ברצועת עזה.\nמוקדם יותר היום, צה\"ל ושב\"כ תקפו באופן ממוקד מחבלים בארגון הטרור… pic.twitter.com/gdLAJOpWJ4\n— צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) May 13, 2025\nSecurity sources said the military was working to confirm if the assassination attempt against Muahmmad Sinwar was successful. If Sinwar was indeed in the tunnel, as the military’s intelligence indicated, he was likely killed, the sources said, adding that there was a small window of opportunity for the strike.\nThe IDF said it took steps to mitigate civilian harm in the strike, including by using precision munitions, aerial surveillance, and other intelligence.\n“The Hamas terror organization continues to use hospitals in the Gaza Strip for terror purposes, cynically and cruelly exploiting the civilian population in and around the hospital,” the military said.\nSeveral hours after the initial attack, Palestinian media reported additional strikes in the area of the hospital, in what appeared to be an attempt by the IDF to prevent anyone from approaching the tunnel where Sinwar was targeted.\n???? مشاهد أخرى للحزام الناري الذي استهدف المستشفى الأوروبي في #خان_يونس جنوب قطاع #غزة. pic.twitter.com/M5C7hvKddI\n— عربي بوست (@arabic_post) May 13, 2025\nSinwar, a senior Hamas military commander, is the younger brother of the former Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by the IDF in southern Gaza last October.\nFollowing the killing of Hamas’s top military commander, Muhammad Deif, last July, Muhammad Sinwar took charge of the terror group’s military wing. Later, after Sinwar’s older brother was killed by IDF troops, he became the de facto leader of the terror group in the Gaza Strip.\nIsraeli officials have described Muhammad Sinwar as obstinate with regard to negotiations with Hamas for the release of hostages, and an obstacle to reaching a ceasefire deal.\nThe younger Sinwar is also wanted for terrorist actions against Israel and has been active in Hamas for decades.\nHe was jailed by Israel in the 1990s for nine months and spent an additional three years in a Palestinian Authority prison in Ramallah, from which he escaped in 2000. In 2006, Sinwar was part of a Hamas cell that abducted IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. He also previously commanded Hamas’s Khan Younis Brigade.\n#عاجل استهداف المستشفى الأوروبي جنوب خان يونس بحرام ناري pic.twitter.com/vCHHtNFlB5\n— Khaled Safi ???????? خالد صافي (@KhaledSafi) May 13, 2025\nMost of Hamas’s leadership has been eliminated by Israel during the ongoing war, which was sparked when the terror group stormed southern Israel on October 7, 2023, to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages.\nOn Tuesday, the IDF and Shin Bet confirmed that an overnight strike killed Hassan Eslaiah, who had joined and recorded the shock assault. The security forces said he was a Hamas operative “operating under the guise of a journalist.”\nThe statement followed Palestinian reports that Eslaiah had been killed in the strike on Khan Younis’s Nasser Hospital, a month after he had survived a previous Israeli targeting.\nEslaiah, whose freelance photography was distributed around the world for the Associated Press, had photographed Gazans, some of them armed, as they stormed Kibbutz Nir Oz, where a quarter of the population was slaughtered or kidnapped, including the elderly and children as young as nine months old.\nHe also took a picture of Gazans atop a burning tank next to the destroyed Gaza border fence. A video from the scene posted to social media and since deleted showed him next to the tank; no press credentials could be seen on him.\nThe IDF said last month that he was a member of Hamas’s Khan Younis Brigade.\nLast month, the IDF announced that it had targeted Eslaiah in an airstrike, but he managed to survive. Palestinian media reported that he was receiving medical care at Nasser Hospital from injuries sustained in the previous strike when he was killed.\nBoth the AP and CNN said in November 2023 that they had severed their relationship with Eslaiah after a pro-Israel watchdog raised questions about their work with the photographer and other journalists who entered Israel during the massacre.\nIsrael has repeatedly alleged that journalists killed in strikes were actually terror operatives who posed as reporters; it maintains that Hamas uses hospitals, schools, shelters, and aid infrastructure as cover for terror activities.\nNurit Yohanan contributed to this report.",

    "date": "Updated 08:28 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "US President Donald Trump signed a host of economic and bilateral cooperation agreements in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, as he kicked off a four-day Middle East trip with a focus on dealmaking with a key Mideast ally while shared concerns about Iran’s nuclear program and the war in Gaza dragged on in the background.\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi de facto ruler, warmly greeted Trump as he stepped off Air Force One at King Khalid International Airport in the Saudi capital. The two leaders then retreated to a grand hall at the Riyadh airport, where Trump and his aides were served traditional Arabic coffee by waiting attendants wearing ceremonial gun belts.\n“I really believe we like each other a lot,” Trump said later during a brief appearance with the crown prince at the start of a bilateral meeting.\nThey later signed more than a dozen agreements to increase cooperation between their governments’ militaries, justice departments, and cultural institutions.\nAdditional economic agreements were expected to be inked later Tuesday at a US-Saudi investment conference convened for the occasion.\nPrince Mohammed has already committed to some $600 billion in new Saudi investment in the US, but Trump teased that $1 trillion would be even better. The agreement includes a mammoth arms deal described by the White House as the largest “in history” between the allies, worth nearly $142 billion.\nThe pomp began before Trump even landed. Royal Saudi Air Force F-15s provided an honorary escort for Air Force One as it approached the kingdom’s capital — an exceptionally rare sight.\nTrump and Prince Mohammed also took part in a formal greeting and lunch at the Royal Court at Al Yamamah Palace, gathering with guests and aides in an ornate room with blue and gold accents and massive crystal chandeliers.\nAs he greeted business titans with Trump by his side, Prince Mohammed was animated and smiling.\nIt was a stark contrast to his awkward fist bump with then-president Joe Biden, who looked to avoid being seen on camera shaking hands with the prince during a 2022 visit to the kingdom.\nBiden had decided to pay a visit to Saudi Arabia as he looked to alleviate soaring prices at the pump for motorists at home and around the globe. At the time, Prince Mohammed’s reputation had been badly damaged by a US intelligence determination that found he had ordered the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nBut that dark moment appeared to be a distant memory for the prince as he rubbed elbows with high-profile business executives — including Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk — in front of the cameras and with Trump by his side.\nLater, the crown prince was set to fete Trump with an intimate state dinner at Ad-Diriyah, a UNESCO heritage site that is the birthplace of the first Saudi state and the site of a major development project championed by the crown prince.\nSaudi Arabia and fellow OPEC+ nations have already helped their cause with Trump early in his second term by stepping up oil production. Trump sees cheap energy as a key component to lowering costs and stemming inflation for Americans. The Republican president has also made the case that lower oil prices will hasten an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\nBut Saudi Arabia’s economy remains heavily dependent on oil, and the kingdom needs a fiscal break-even oil price of $96 to $98 a barrel to balance its budget. It’s questionable how long OPEC+, of which Saudi Arabia is the leading member, is willing to keep production elevated. The price of a barrel of Brent crude closed Monday at $64.77.\nTrump picked the kingdom for his first stop because it has pledged to make big investments in the US, but he ended up traveling to Italy last month for Pope Francis’ funeral. Riyadh was the first overseas stop of his first term.\nThe three countries on Trump’s itinerary — Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates — are places where the Trump Organization, run by the president’s two oldest sons, is developing major real estate projects. They include a high-rise tower in Jeddah, a luxury hotel in Dubai, and a golf course and villa complex in Qatar.\nTrump is trying to demonstrate that his transactional strategy for international politics is paying dividends as he faces criticism from Democrats who say his global tariff war and approach to Russia’s war on Ukraine are isolating the US from allies.\nBut Trump arrived in the Middle East when his top regional allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia, are far from neatly aligned with his approach.\nBefore the trip, Trump announced Washington was halting a nearly two-month US airstrike campaign against Yemen’s Houthis, saying the Iran-backed rebels have pledged to stop attacking ships along a vital global trade route.\nThe administration didn’t notify Israel, which the Houthis continued to target, including with a missile attack on Tuesday evening, of the agreement before Trump publicly announced it. It was the latest example of Trump leaving the Israelis in the dark about his administration’s negotiations with common adversaries.\nIn March, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t notified by the administration until after talks began with Hamas about the war in Gaza. And Netanyahu found out about the ongoing US nuclear talks with Iran only when Trump announced them during an Oval Office visit by the Israeli leader last month.\n“Israel will defend itself by itself,” Netanyahu said last week following Trump’s Houthi truce announcement. “If others join us — our American friends — all the better.”\nWilliam Wechsler, senior director of the Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council, said Trump’s decision to skip Israel on his first Middle East visit was remarkable.\n“The main message coming out of this, at least as the itinerary stands today, is that the governments of the Gulf … are in fact stronger friends to President Trump than the current government of Israel at this moment,” Wechsler said.",

    "article": "The Israel Defense Forces on Tuesday confirmed that it had launched a “routine” Military Police campaign to detain people who ignored enlistment orders following the latest round of call-ups.\nNews of the arrest raids sparked a political firestorm, with ultra-Orthodox politicians threatening to bring down the government over the move. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is already on rocky ground due to its failure so far to pass legislation reestablishing yeshiva students’ exemptions from military service, which were struck down by the High Court last year.\nIn a statement, the IDF said, “Last night, there was an [arrest] operation close to the draft period as has been carried out previously, in an equal manner across all segments of society and against anyone who did not show up as required.”\nThe comment came after reports claimed that the army would launch large-scale arrest raids on Wednesday targeting Haredi draft dodgers.\nThe army said the campaign on Monday night was aimed at a total of 36 people evading conscription, and not just ultra-Orthodox men. The IDF would first make contact with those not showing up at induction centers and attempt to sort the matter out voluntarily, and would only afterward carry out arrests.\nIt is unclear how many arrests actually took place.\nThe detainees would either face disciplinary measures or a criminal trial, depending on how long they had ignored draft orders. In general, Military Police arrest campaigns are aimed at those who ignore recent draft orders, and therefore only face disciplinary — not criminal — measures.\nIt was the third arrest campaign against draft dodgers since the beginning of the war, with the previous ones taking place in November 2024 and March 2025, according to the army.\nThe military noted that last week, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir instructed the Personnel Directorate to come up with a plan to send out more draft orders to members of the ultra-Orthodox community\n“The plan is currently being prepared,” the IDF said.\nSpeaking with the Haredi news site Kikar Hashabbat last week, UTJ lawmaker Yaakov Asher warned that if the Knesset did not pass draft exemption legislation by the end of the summer session, on July 27, his party would no longer be able to remain in the government.\n“If this law does not pass in this session… we will have a very big problem sitting in such a government, period,” he said, adding that UTJ “cannot be part of a government” that turns Haredim into “criminals.”\nShas and United Torah Judaism are currently boycotting private member bills brought by members of the coalition in an effort to pressure Netanyahu to push the controversial enlistment legislation through.\nWith the news that the IDF plans on significantly increasing enforcement, many in the Haredi community are “very worried,” Yisroel Cohen, an ultra-Orthodox journalist with close ties to the Haredi parties, told The Times of Israel on Tuesday.\n“It could bring this whole story to an explosive end. If they arrest even one or two yeshiva students in the street, it could bring about a big crisis, even potentially prompting the Haredim to dismantle the government,” he said.\n“If they go to the yeshivas, it will breach every red line,” Cohen added.\nSenior ultra-Orthodox political officials informed Netanyahu on Tuesday that the launch of a large-scale enforcement operation against Haredi draft dodgers could bring about their “immediate resignation from the government,” national broadcaster Kan reported.\nSpeaking with the Ynet news site, a senior Haredi party official declared that “if dozens and hundreds of yeshiva students are indeed arrested, as we are currently seeing, these will be the government’s final days.”\nSimilarly, an unnamed United Torah Judaism official told Army Radio that “as soon as there is one arrest tomorrow, we will shut down the government and begin the dissolution process.”\nThis rhetoric echoed Shas chairman Aryeh Deri’s statement last month that the government would not survive the arrest of yeshiva students.\n“As long as… there is no proactive action by the state to arrest yeshiva students, we will continue to be part of the government, but as soon as there is such an arrest, even one… that is a red line for us,” Deri told his ultra-Orthodox party’s HaDerech newspaper.”We will not be able to continue to be a part of such a government.”\nUnlike the Haredim, the leaders of the Knesset opposition welcomed the operation, with Opposition Leader Yair Lapid tweeting that “the Military Police are not ‘arresting Haredim,’ they are arresting young Israelis who received a draft order during the war and did not show up at the military induction base to enlist in the defense of the country.”\n“The law is the law, recruitment is recruitment, and equality is equality. Don’t stop, recruit everyone,” tweeted The Democrats chairman Yair Golan.\nMilitary officials have acknowledged that in practice, the IDF had not been enforcing the draft orders it was sending out to Haredim.\n“We don’t enforce the draft orders for the ultra-Orthodox enough. There is almost no enforcement of them,” an official told reporters earlier this week.\n“We don’t want Military Police battalions to storm Bnei Brak, Modi’in Illit, and Beitar Illit,” the official said, referring to three major ultra-Orthodox cities. “We want to increase enforcement, but it’s difficult for us.”\nNormally, after ignoring two draft orders, a potential conscript receives an immediate call-up order and must show up at an induction center within 48 hours or be declared a draft evader.\nThe consequences of being declared a draft evader include receiving a “no exit order” — being barred from leaving the country. In addition, during any encounter with the police, the draft dodger can be arrested. The exact timeline between the draft orders varies.\nCurrently, approximately 80,000 Haredi men between the ages of 18 and 24 are eligible for military service and have not enlisted.\nThe IDF in the coming weeks will complete sending out draft orders to 24,000 Haredi men, wrapping up an effort that began last summer but has seen only a handful enlist. As of late April, only 232 of those who have received orders have enlisted — 57 of them in combat roles.\nIn total, just over 1,800 Haredim have enlisted in the IDF since last summer, far fewer than the military’s goal of 4,800.\nAs of early February, arrest warrants had been issued for 1,212 Haredim who ignored multiple enlistment orders, a number that has likely increased in the interim.\nDuring a discussion in the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee last week, Brig. Gen. Shay Tayeb, head of the IDF Personnel Directorate’s Planning and Personnel Management Division, told lawmakers the IDF has three main enforcement mechanisms: stopping people at Ben Gurion Airport, random police checks, and dedicated operations against evaders.\nSuch operations have been limited over the last year and a half as the bulk of the Military Police’s resources have been tied up in imprisoning captured terrorists, he said.\nAccording to Tayeb, since the beginning of the year, 340 Israelis who received military draft orders and dodged service were detained while trying to leave the country — 52 of whom had recently received orders as part of an effort to recruit ultra-Orthodox men. Of those who were detained, 23 have since been drafted to the IDF, he said.\nSpeaking with the committee last month, Lt. Col. Avigdor Dickstein, head of the Haredi branch of the IDF’s Personnel Directorate, seemed to indicate that the army sees large-scale arrest operations as ineffective.\n“Currently, the most significant and effective sanction is Ben Gurion Airport; there is currently no other sanction,” Dickstein asserted. “There is the ability to make arrests, but it is extremely ineffective. If I grab him and put him in a police car, will he end up enlisting?”\nSpeaking with The Times of Israel last week, former IDF chief military defense counsel Col. (res.) Ran Cohen Rochverger alleged that from November 2023 until this April, the military had significantly increased penalties for desertion against regular service and reserve troops, without a corresponding change in legal consequences for draft evaders.\nThe Ynet news site recently reported that the IDF had been in contact with the Justice Ministry to discuss the use of available sanctions, including ones that could have a significant economic impact on evaders.\nUnder existing laws, it is possible to block draft dodgers from obtaining drivers licenses, receiving passports or renewing their state identification cards, Deputy Knesset Speaker Evgeny Sova told The Times of Israel on Tuesday.\n“You can do that today, but the state doesn’t do it,” he said. “But you can’t carry on with your life, use state services in a normal and regular way without actually settling this matter.”\nThe government has also done little, if anything, to combat those actively encouraging yeshiva students to dodge the draft.\nSince the High Court of Justice’s ruling in June 2024 ending the exemption of Haredim from military service, multiple initiatives affiliated with various Haredi factions have sprung up to guide young men through their new post-exemption reality, and encourage them to disregard IDF enlistment orders.\nThe Israel Police and the attorney general appear to have failed to crack down on such groups, despite demands for investigation by advocacy groups and lawmakers. Under the law, someone inciting others to evade service during wartime is liable for a prison term of 15 years.",

    "date": "Updated 09:55 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "Education Minister Yoav Kisch threatened on Tuesday to revoke funding for Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University over student rallies commemorating the Nakba, or “catastrophe,” the Arabic term for the expulsion and exodus of some 700,000 Palestinians during Israel’s 1948 War of Independence.\n“Academia is not a platform for incitement under the guise of freedom of expression,” Kisch wrote in a post on X, adding that he had appealed to Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich to revoke funding for the universities.\nSmotrich later said in a statement that he supported the move and would “instruct the professional authorities to immediately act on revoking the funding.”\nThe universities rejected Kisch’s threat, saying they supported their students’ freedom of speech. Smotrich would have difficulty revoking the schools’ budgets under the so-called Nakba Law, legislation passed in 2011 that empowers the finance minister to penalize institutions that fund activities marking Independence Day as a “day of mourning.”\nNakba Day is traditionally observed on May 15 — the day in 1948 when the British Mandate ended, and a day after Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben Gurion, announced the state’s establishment.\nIsrael celebrates its Independence Day according to the Hebrew anniversary of Ben Gurion’s declaration. The country marked its 77th Independence Day on May 1.\nStudents at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem held a Nakba ceremony on Monday, and Tel Aviv University students are set to hold one on Wednesday.\nYESTERDAY: Dozens of Palestinian students and supporters protest at the Hebrew University, built on Jabal al-Masharif, in Jerusalem, as part of Nakba Week, organized to highlight the ongoing Nakba and the genocide in Gaza.

Past campus Nakba memorial demonstrations have seen violence erupt between protesters and counter-protesters.\nNoting that students at Hebrew University had waved Palestinian flags on Monday, Im Tirtzu said it “won’t be silent as terrorist flags are waved, and won’t allow the desecration of the day the country was established.”\nPalestinian student groups at Hebrew University said Monday that commemorating Nakba Day was even more essential this year, “as the genocide against our people in Gaza continues.”\n“Let us raise our voices against this genocide and displacement,” a statement from the groups said, adding that they would pass the day reading letters and poems from people in the Strip, which has been devastated by 19 months of war sparked by the Hamas onslaught of October 7, 2023.\nBoth Tel Aviv University and the Hebrew University said in statements that they supported their students’ right to mark the Nakba, and called Kisch’s threats illegal.\n“Tel Aviv University categorically rejects the Minister of Education’s appalling threats to take illegal action and withhold funding from the university,” Tel Aviv University said in a statement.\nThe university said that under Israeli law, “demonstrations initiated by students on Nakba Day, which is held at most Israeli universities, are protected by the freedom of expression and protest.”\nThe Hebrew University responded similarly, saying that Kisch’s “directive is without any legal foundation or statutory support.”\n“The Hebrew University is committed to fostering coexistence across all segments of Israeli society,” the statement said. “As part of its dedication to freedom of expression, the university ensures that diverse voices can be heard — embracing complexity in dialogue and encouraging mutual respect.”\nKisch responded on X that embracing such events “prevents academic freedom,” and that “any students who think that Nakba Day is a national day of mourning are invited to study at Birzeit University and not at the university of the first Zionist city in Israel.” Birzeit is a major Palestinian university in the West Bank.\nKisch said that under the law, institutions supporting Nakba Day activities should expect to have their budgets denied.\nThe Nakba Law allows the finance minister to cut an institution’s state funds by up to three times the money that the institution had spent in support of actions that incite to racism or violence, mourn Independence Day or deny Israel’s existence as a Jewish and democratic state. That means Smotrich would have to prove that Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University had themselves funded their students’ Nakba commemorations.\nKisch has previously clashed with university heads over their threats to go on strike if the government proceeded with steps to weaken the judiciary.\nIsraeli universities have suspended Arab students over social media posts seen as supporting the October 7 Hamas onslaught. Haifa University, where roughly 40 percent of the student body is Arab, in April suspended a Jewish-Arab student group that had held an unauthorized anti-war sit-in.\nAccording to the Central Bureau of Statistics, Arabs make up roughly 19% of the student body in higher education, compared to their 21% share in Israel’s population at large.",

    "date": "Updated 09:56 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "US President Donald Trump said Tuesday he will move to normalize relations and lift sanctions on Syria’s new government to give the country “a chance at peace.”\nTrump is set to meet Wednesday in Saudi Arabia with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, the onetime insurgent who last year led the overthrow of former leader Bashar al-Assad. He said the effort at rapprochement came at the urging of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi de facto ruler, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n“There is a new government that will hopefully succeed,” Trump said of Syria, adding, “I say good luck, Syria. Show us something special.”\nSyria’s Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani said Tuesday that Trump’s decision to lift sanctions was a “pivotal turning point for the Syrian people, as we move toward a future of stability, self-sufficiency and genuine reconstruction after years of destructive war.”\nSharaa will be the first Syrian leader to meet an American president since the late Hafez al-Assad met Bill Clinton in Geneva in 2000.\nIt was a major boost for the Syrian president, who at one point was imprisoned in Iraq for his role in the insurgency following the 2003 US-led invasion of the Arab country. Sharaa was named president of Syria in January, a month after a stunning offensive by insurgent groups led by Sharaa’s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, stormed Damascus, ending the 54-year rule of the Assad family.\nAccording to the London Times, citing unnamed security sources, Sharaa may use the meeting to offer talks on normalizing relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords.\nA US security source confirmed the possibility of Damascus joining the accords, with the United Arab Emirates as a mediator. Sharaa confirmed last week that Abu Dhabi is already acting as an intermediary between Israel and Syria, with talks focusing on security and intelligence matters and confidence-building between the two countries, which have no official relations.\nThe source added that Washington and Gulf countries are seeking to pull Syria away from Iranian influence. Tehran, sworn to Israel’s destruction, propped up the former Assad regime throughout the bloody Syrian civil war.\nThe US has been weighing how to handle Sharaa since he took power in December. Gulf leaders have rallied behind the new government in Damascus and will want Trump to follow, believing it is a bulwark against Iran’s return to influence in Syria.\nThen-president Joe Biden left the decision to Trump, whose administration has yet to formally recognize the new Syrian government.\n“The president agreed to say hello to the Syrian President while in Saudi Arabia tomorrow,” the White House said before Trump’s remarks.\nThe comments marked a striking change in tone from Trump and put him at odds with Israel, which has been deeply skeptical of Sharaa’s extremist past and cautioned against swift recognition of the new government.\nFormerly known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, Sharaa joined the ranks of al-Qaida insurgents battling US forces in Iraq after the US-led invasion in 2003. He still faces a warrant for his arrest on terrorism charges in Iraq, and the US once offered $10 million for information about his whereabouts because of his links to al-Qaida.\nIn 2011, Sharaa came back to his home country, where he led the branch of al-Qaida that was known as the Nusra Front. He later changed the name of his group to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and cut links with al-Qaida.\nSyria has had fraught relations with Washington since the days of the Cold War, when Damascus maintained close links with the Soviet Union and later became Iran’s closest ally in the Arab world.\nLondon-based Syrian analyst Ibrahim Hamidi said Trump’s meeting with Sharaa marks a “strategic shift” in the country, with Iran forced to leave and Russia, which also backed Assad and now gives him sanctuary, weakened.\n“The Syrian-American meetings in Riyadh open the gate for the two sides to start discussing disagreements and issues between them with an atmosphere of dialogue,” said Hamidi, editor-in-chief of the Arabic magazine Al Majalla. “This is important.”",

    "date": "Updated 11:23 PM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "TENAFLY, New Jersey — The crowd in Edan Alexander’s New Jersey hometown cheered when an Israeli news broadcast said he had been transferred to Red Cross custody on Monday. The hundreds in attendance cheered again when Alexander was taken in by the Israel Defense Forces, and again when he crossed the border into Israel.\n“It’s been a really difficult period and this is the first time we’ve actually come together to celebrate and we just can’t wait for him to come home,” said Jamie Corsair, a town resident whose son is close friends with Alexander.\nAlexander, 21, was born to Israeli parents and raised in Tenafly, a leafy suburb across the Hudson River from the Bronx. He joined the IDF after graduating from high school and was taken hostage during Hamas’s October 7, 2023, invasion of Israel. He was released on Monday after 584 days in captivity.\nTenafly is home to a sizable Jewish and Israeli expat community. Cafes around the town center have signs in Hebrew, and local high schools released their students from class for the day to attend the celebratory gathering, held in the town’s central Huyler Park.\nGroups of high schoolers draped in Israeli flags danced and sang along to Israeli pop songs, such as “Happiness Revolution,” by Lior Narkis and Omer Adam. Some in the crowd cried and embraced family members, while others clustered in camping chairs in the shade beneath the park’s trees.\nOrganizers set up a towering screen and sound system tuned into Israel’s Channel 12 news broadcast of Alexander’s release. The rapt crowd watched each development, chatting in Hebrew and English and waving Israeli flags.\nMany wore shirts with Alexander’s image and trees around the park were draped with yellow ribbons, a symbol of the hostages. A yellow banner reading “Welcome home Edan” hung beneath the screen, and attendees scrawled messages to Alexander on a piece of white posterboard.\n“Welcome home Edan. We have all been praying for you and haShem finally answered our prayers,” one of the messages said.\n“How long we’ve waited for you. Finally you’re coming back to us,” another handwritten sign said in Hebrew.\nThe town has been focused on Alexander since he was taken hostage, with signs calling for his release in restaurants, supermarkets, and on lawns.\n“You can’t go anywhere without seeing Edan Alexander’s face,” said Paula Eiselt, a resident of neighboring Teaneck who is making a film series about the fallout from October 7 in the US. “There’s tremendous joy for this community, especially in that everyone is so connected to this family and to Israel.”\nThe crowd began gathering around 5 a.m., through messages passed around via email and WhatsApp messaging groups.\n“Yes, it’s early. And yes, it might be a little cold. But we are strong, united, and our love will warm us all,” said one of the messages, which urged parents to let their children participate in the gathering at the cost of going to school: “Let them experience a morning they’ll remember for life.”\nSome members of the crowd knew the Alexander family personally. Corsair used to host Alexander at her home when her son and Alexander were in high school. Leat Corinne Unger, whose cousin Omer Shem Tov was released from Hamas captivity in March, campaigned for the hostages’ release with Alexander’s parents.\n“We were on such a long road together, so I’m elated,” Unger said.\nDespite her cousin being released, “a big part of it felt like a piece was missing, because from my hometown there was still a boy who was missing,” she said. “Our town feels a little more complete now.”\n“Everybody feels that Edan is part of their family. He’s like their nephew, he’s like their son,” she said.\nDespite the celebration, the event was tinged with sorrow for the hostages still held captive by Hamas. In between the songs and dancing, the crowd chanted, “Bring them home,” for the remaining hostages.\n“I’m also sad. There are 58 more that we’re waiting for,” Unger said.\nJTA contributed to this report.",

    "headline": "New York City mayor opens new task force aimed at combating antisemitism",
    "subheading": "Eric Adams cites need for ‘decisive action’ as he announces Office to Combat Antisemitism, 1st of its kind in a major US city, amid upsurge in anti-Jewish hate crimes",
    "date": "Updated 06:33 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Monday announced a new office aimed at combating antisemitism, amid a sustained surge in anti-Jewish hate crimes following the October 2023 invasion of Israel.\nThe Office to Combat Antisemitism, a citywide bureau under the mayor’s purview, is the first of its kind in a major US city.\nThe office will establish an inter-agency task force for fighting antisemitism, the mayor’s office told The Times of Israel. Its activities will include monitoring court cases related to anti-Jewish crimes, giving advice on executive orders and legislation, and liaising with the New York City Law Department, the department that handles most of the city’s legal affairs.\nThe antisemitism bureau will also have the authority to enforce a ban on antisemitism at city-funded agencies. Recent incidents at city agencies include a New York City Department of Education office sending out a toolkit with antisemitic language, and a city parks office booking Kehlani, an anti-Israel singer who has called for an intifada and the destruction of Israel. Kehlani’s Central Park concert was canceled amid pressure from the mayor’s office.\nAdams appointed Moshe Davis, his Jewish liaison since 2022, to head the new office. Davis will start by forming a commission of New York City Jewish leaders to advise the new bureau. Davis will report to Randy Mastro, the city’s first deputy mayor.\n“This office will be a sledgehammer: deliberate, coordinated and unapologetic,” Davis said at a Tuesday press briefing. “We’re all in the same boat. This isn’t a Jewish issue, this is a New York issue.”\nThe mayor’s office cited the high rate of antisemitism as a reason for establishing the office. Last year, 54% of all hate crimes in New York City targeted Jews, and during the first quarter of this year, that figure climbed to 62%, according to NYPD data. Jews represent around 10% of the city population.\n“This moment calls for decisive action,” Adams said in a statement. “Antisemitism is an attack not only on Jewish New Yorkers, but on the very idea of New York City as a place where people from all backgrounds can live together.”\nAdams announced the task force at a Monday briefing in City Hall, flanked by Hasidic, Orthodox, and secular community leaders, including representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York, and the UJA-Federation of New York.\nAdams, a former NYPD officer and Brooklyn borough president, has strong ties to New York Jewish communities, particularly in Brooklyn, and is a vocal supporter of Israel and the Jewish community. He announced the task force while standing next to Devorah Halberstam, whose son, Ari, was murdered in an antisemitic attack in 1994. Adams and Halberstam have been close since then.\nIn 2023, Adams formed the city’s first Jewish Advisory Council, a group charged with improving Jewish life in the city. Another program, called Breaking Bread, Building Bonds, is aimed at combating hatred more generally.\nThe Trump administration established a federal antisemitism task force in February.\nAdams’s predecessor Bill de Blasio opened the city’s Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes in 2019, largely in response to antisemitism. Adams said the new task force will complement the hate crimes unit.\nThe new office’s scope extends beyond hate crimes with its oversight of city agencies.\n“There are many rivers that feed the sea of antisemitism,” Adams said, citing rhetoric at schools and colleges. “We have to proactively monitor what is leaving our agencies. We cannot be the feeder of hate.”\nThe broader focus could cause conflicts as the office navigates the line between anti-Israel speech and antisemitism. Jewish New Yorkers have been unnerved by hundreds of anti-Israel protests on city streets since October 7, including in Jewish neighborhoods. Adams has defended the right to protest and criticize Israel, including on Tuesday.\n“You have a right to free speech and you have a right to have your opinion,” he said. “We want to make sure that free speech does not cross the line into hate.”\nThe details of the task force’s oversight of city agencies remain unclear. Davis declined to confirm whether the new office will adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which covers some forms of Israel criticism. There will be further details available about the task force’s protocols in the coming weeks, he said.\nAdams said that advocating for Palestinians does not constitute antisemitism, but indicated he personally views anti-Zionism as antisemitic.\n“If you’re saying, ‘Eradicate Israel, destroy Israel,’ I mean, who lives in Israel?” Adams said. “If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, call it a duck.”\nAdams has been battered over corruption allegations and his ties to the Trump administration in the past year.\nHe is up for reelection in November. The city’s Democratic Party primary, which typically decides who will win the general election in the mostly Democratic city, will take place next month. Adams announced last month that he will run as an independent.\nFormer New York governor Andrew Cuomo has a commanding lead in polls for the primary, and has also been pitching to Jewish voters and prioritizing the fight against antisemitism, making several stops at synagogues in recent weeks.\nAdams has reportedly petitioned to run in the mayoral race on an “EndAntiSemitism” ballot line.\nJews have been disproportionately targeted in hate crimes in New York for years, including before the October 2023 Hamas attack. When de Blasio announced the Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes, Jews were also targeted in 60% of hate crimes. Adams said the task force was starting this week, despite that history, as part of a long “evolution” in his approach to combating hate.",

    "date": "Updated 02:44 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "Israel Police recently used artificial intelligence to prepare arguments for a criminal case, utilizing a large language model AI like ChatGPT and citing legislation that does not exist in Israel’s legal code, Hebrew media reported Tuesday.\nAccording to the reports in Hebrew media, Judge Ehud Kaplan of the Hadera Magistrate’s Court reacted in astonishment to the police’s argument, saying: “I thought I had seen everything in 30 years on the bench.”\nThe case in question centers on Ibrahim Mahajne, a resident of Wadi Ara who is being investigated on suspicion of money laundering, embezzlement and tax fraud by the Lahav 433 major crimes unit.\nMahajne’s phone was among several belongings seized during the investigation, with police saying it was necessary evidence in their probe of the case.\nIn court, the defendant’s lawyers requested his phone be returned to him, arguing that it was a crucial part of his business due to the fact that it is connected to the security and alarm system, saying that the system cannot be operated without his phone.\nMahajne claimed that his business was broken into recently, and the alarm was never triggered because his phone was not connected to the security system.\nAccording to the reports, Mahajne’s lawyers noticed that in the police’s argument against returning his device, they cited laws that do not exist in Israel’s legal code.\nDuring the hearing, Mahajne’s attorney Tamir Calderon told the court that he “suspects that the police response was taken from ChatGPT. The sections of law cited do not exist.”\nEmbarrassed, the police representative told the court that the defense team was right, and that the made-up law was cited “by mistake.”\n“We take it back. What was quoted is incorrect. Whoever wrote this did so in good faith, by mistake,” they said. “We admit that there was a mistake.”\nAstonished, Judge Kaplan said: “If I thought I had seen everything in the 30 years I have been on the bench, I must have been wrong.” He emphasized that “one of those ‘laws’ has not even existed in anyone’s imagination until now,” and that even a Google search for such a law doesn’t yield any results.\nAccording to the reports, the judge then told the police to copy the data from the cell phone in question to a blank device, ordering them to return the original device to Mahajne within five days.\nResponding to the incident, a police representative said that the legal argument was “written contrary to accepted practice,” and that the commander of the unit in charge of the investigation ordered a probe into the incident “to prevent the recurrence of similar cases in the future.”",

    "date": "Updated 05:19 AM GMT+5:30, May 15, 2025",
    "article": "A US-backed aid organization established to manage a new model for distributing humanitarian assistance in Gaza announced Wednesday that it would begin operating in the enclave by the end of the month and that Israel would lift its over two-month blockade in the interim.\nThere was no Israeli confirmation of the latter announcement by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), but an Israeli official told The Times of Israel that one would be made in the coming days.\nGHF is an organization established earlier this year in close coordination with Israel to oversee the distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza in a manner that does not allow its diversion by Hamas amid mounting mistrust between Jerusalem and UN-backed aid groups who have been operating in the Strip to date.\nGHF is backed by the Trump administration, but its rollout has been rocky, with many international organizations refusing to cooperate due to the strict conditions Israel is placing on its operations.\nAmong those restrictions was a limit on aid distribution sites to just four all located in southern Gaza. Even GHF acknowledged in a memo earlier this month that this would only be enough to at best feed 60% of Gaza’s population.\nAccordingly, GHF said in its inaugural Wednesday statement that it had asked and received Israeli approval for additional “Safe Distribution Sites” (SDSs) to be established throughout Gaza. The statement doesn’t say how many SDSs Israel agreed to build. As of last week, only one SDS was in the process of construction by the IDF.\nGHF said it would launch operations by the end of May, but acknowledged that it would take time before it would take time before it would be fully operational. Accordingly, the foundation said Israel has agreed “to allow the flow of transitional aid into Gaza under existing mechanisms” until the construction of SDSs is complete.\nGHF said it secured the concession from Israel after it sent a letter to the Israeli government that outlined the organization’s requirements for operation. The letter was sent by Jake Wood, the founder and former CEO of the Team Rubicon disaster relief group, who has agreed to come on as GHF’s executive director.\n“There is no time to wait for ideal conditions. We have a responsibility to act and to do it without compromising our values,” Wood said in a statement.\n“Today we are one step closer to doing just that. GHF’s neutral, cooperative, and secure model will allow NGOs and humanitarian groups to operate safely, with minimized aid interdiction, resulting in maximum life-saving impact,” he added.\nIt is unclear which aid organizations will cooperate with GHF, though. UN-backed aid organizations currently operating in Gaza issued a joint statement earlier this month saying they would not join the effort, arguing that Israel’s conditions on GHF would leave vulnerable populations without humanitarian assistance.\nHumanitarian workers criticized the initial plan to have just four distribution sites in Gaza, along with other criteria only allowing one family representative chosen by Israel to pick up a roughly 40-lb box of assistance once every two weeks. They also argued that the requirement to then carry the box of aid long distances still exposed recipients to Hamas looting.\nHowever, the GHF statement said it was in the “final stages” of securing enough food from aid organizations already operating in Gaza to box 300 million meals within the first 90 days of operation.\nMeanwhile, Trump officials have been meeting in recent days with representatives from UN agencies and other international aid organizations, pressuring them to cooperate with the plan and — in at least one case — threatening to cut funding from groups that refuse.\nTwo organizations that have agreed to join the effort are American security firms UG Solutions and Safe Reach Solutions, who will be tasked with running logistics and security at the SDSs so that the IDF does not need to be directly involved, the Israeli official told The Times of Israel, adding that the military will only secure the perimeter of a still-being-built humanitarian zone where the SDSs will be located.\nIsrael has blocked aid from entering Gaza since March 2, arguing that enough assistance entered Gaza during a six-week ceasefire and that Hamas was diverting aid from civilians. Nonetheless, the IDF has warned the political echelon that the Strip is on the brink of starvation, the Israeli official told The Times of Israel.\nIn his letter to the Israeli government, Wood sought to address some of the concerns. He said the foundation would not share any personally identifiable information of aid recipients with Israel.\nWood also asked in the letter for the IDF to “identify and deconflict sufficient locations in northern Gaza capable of hosting GHF-operated secure distribution sites that can be made operational within thirty days.”\nIsrael is planning to launch a massive military operation as early as Friday that aims to reoccupy and permanently hold onto the entire Strip, while squeezing the entire population into a small humanitarian zone in the southern Strip that makes up less than a quarter of the enclave’s territory.\nWood asked Israel to facilitate the flow of enough aid “using existing modalities” now until GHF’s infrastructure is fully operational, saying this is essential to “alleviate the ongoing humanitarian pressure, as well as decrease the pressure on the distribution sites during our first days of operation.”\nThe GHF statement identified several US military veterans, former humanitarian coordinators and security contractors that it said would lead the delivery effort. However, a GHF memo distributed to potential donor countries and organizations included names of several individuals it claimed would sit on its board, even though they had never agreed to do so, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\nThe GHF statement did not address all of the criticism and unanswered questions that the international community has about the group, including who would fund the work and how much involvement the US, Israel or any other government or military would have in controlling life-saving aid for Palestinian civilians.\nLast week, the UAE turned down a request to bankroll GHF, a senior official familiar with the matter told The Times of Israel.\nThe rejection marked a major blow to the initiative, as Israel hoped that Emirati support would help convince other countries and international organizations to follow suit.\nEmirati officials told their Israeli counterparts that the UAE would not be able to provide such financial support because the GHF initiative, as it currently stands, does not properly address the humanitarian crisis, the official said, confirming an Axios report.\nThe official stressed that Abu Dhabi’s position could change if the initiative is adapted to properly meet the moment. It was not immediately clear if the changes Wood said he had secured would be enough to convince the UAE to change its mind.\nAgencies contributed to this report.",

    "date": "Updated 10:41 PM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "Hundreds of teachers gathered in Tel Aviv’s Habima Square on Wednesday night to demonstrate against recent salary cuts amid ongoing disputes between Israel’s educators and the finance and education ministries.\nSome 1,000 people were in attendance, according to an estimate published by Ynet, and Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai joined the demonstration in solidarity.\nTurnout was significantly lower than organizers had hoped, as according to Channel 12, the teachers’ union had expected some 8,000 people to attend.\nTeachers across Israel in recent weeks have been striking, first lawfully and later by taking sick leave after the Finance Ministry decided to cut public sector salaries by 3.3% to help finance the war against Hamas in Gaza.\nAddressing the crowd at Habima Square, Secondary Schools Teachers Association Chairman Ran Erez said that the aim of the protest was to “convey to the government that the public is no longer willing to remain silent.”\nThe strike began earlier this month with the delayed opening of elementary schools on May 4, as some teachers only reported to work at 10 a.m., and others did not show up at all.\nWhile the strike resulted in the Finance Ministry reaching an agreement with the Israel Teachers Union that same day, in which salaries would be cut by 0.95% rather than 3.3%, many teachers were unhappy with union leader Yaffa Ben David’s concessions in the negotiations.\nIn response, they continued with an unofficial strike, calling in sick for several days in a row, until the Tel Aviv Labor Court ruled that they could not legally strike over the issue and ordered them to return to work.\nThe following day, the teachers’ union and the Finance Ministry came to an agreement, under which monthly wages will be cut by 0.95% and two additional vacation days would be added, on the Lag B’Omer festival this year and next year.\nAfter the strike concluded, however, thousands of teachers were informed that they should once again expect a reduced paycheck, as the Education Ministry informed them that the days of work they had missed would be considered “absences due to strike” and so they would not receive sick pay, despite calling in sick.\nThe decision would apply even to those who submit doctors’ notes, with several exceptions in place for circumstances including if the teacher was hospitalized, underwent any medical procedures, or is pregnant.\nCommenting on the Labor Court’s ruling, Erez told the protesters that while they may not legally be allowed to launch additional strikes against the salary cuts, the union would “continue to fight through protests, in the media, in advertisements, until these ministers who are harming us understand that without education, this country has no future.”\nSpeaking to Ynet at Habima Square, Corinne Levy, a teacher from Ashdod explained that she was protesting “on behalf of all the teachers who face the impossible every day…even when the system collapses, even when the pay is embarrassing, even when our dignity is trampled on.”\n“We are here because we are fed up with the Finance Ministry trampling on us. We are not asking for handouts, we are demanding justice and fair pay,” she said. “Without teachers, there is no country, without teachers, there is no future.”",

    "date": "Updated 08:57 PM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "LONDON (AP) — Gary Lineker, the former England soccer star who became a leading sports broadcaster on the BBC, has “apologized unreservedly” for reposting an Instagram story about Zionism which featured a picture of a rat.\nIn a statement Wednesday, Lineker, 64, said he reposted material which he has since subsequently learned contained “offensive references,” adding that he withdrew the post as soon as he became aware of the issue.\n“I take full responsibility for this mistake,” said Lineker. “I would never knowingly share anything antisemitic. It goes against everything I believe in.”\nLineker came under criticism on Tuesday after he shared a post from the group, Palestine Lobby, illustrated with a picture of a rat, titled: “Zionism explained in two minutes.”\nRats, linked to disease and dirt, have been used to represent Jews in antisemitic propaganda throughout history, including by the Nazis in 1930s Germany.\nLineker, who steps down as the main presenter of the BBC’s flagship soccer highlights program “Match of the Day” later this month after more than 25 years at the helm, is no stranger to controversy.\nThe former Tottenham Hotspur and Barcelona striker has been reprimanded on prior occasions over his activities on social media. Most notably, he was temporarily suspended from the BBC in March 2023 after an impartiality row over comments he made criticizing the then Conservative government’s new asylum policy, comparing MPs’ rhetoric to Nazi Germany.\nHe was among 500 other high-profile figures who signed an open letter in February urging the BBC to re-broadcast a documentary, “Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone,” to its streaming service, BBC iPlayer. The documentary was pulled after it emerged that its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a senior Hamas official.\n“Whilst I strongly believe in the importance of speaking out on humanitarian issues, including the tragedy unfolding in Gaza, I also know that how we do so matters,” he said in his apology Wednesday.\nThough Lineker is leaving his role at “Match of the Day,” he has signed a contract extension that will see him host the national broadcaster’s coverage of the FA Cup through to 2026 as well as next year’s World Cup tournament in North America. He has for years been the BBC’s highest-paid star.\nPrior to Lineker’s apology, the BBC’s director-general Tim Davie said the broadcaster’s reputation is “held by everyone and when someone makes a mistake, it costs us.”\nHe added: “And I think we absolutely need people to be the exemplars of BBC values and follow our social media policies, simple as that.”\nThe Campaign Against Antisemitism has urged Davie to sack Lineker, who is also the co-founder of the hugely successful “Goalhanger” podcasts, makers of the popular “The Rest is History” series and its spin-offs about politics, football, entertainment and money.\n“As the BBC’s highest-paid presenter and owner of a major media enterprise, maybe he knows exactly what he’s doing,” a spokesperson for the organization said. “Having looked the other way until now, at this point, it is clear that Mr. Lineker’s continued association with the BBC is untenable. He must go.”",

    "date": "Updated 08:57 PM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "JTA — About half of American Jews describe President Donald Trump as antisemitic, while only a minority think his campus crackdown is reducing antisemitism, according to a new survey.\nAmerican Jews are also broadly critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and fewer of them say they feel an attachment to Israel than before the current Israel-Hamas war, which began with the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led atrocities, according to the survey.\nThe survey of Jewish registered voters, conducted by the polling firm GBAO Strategies, found that 52% of respondents say the word “antisemitic” describes the president very or somewhat well.\nIn addition, 74% of respondents disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president, while 26% approve. Close to 70% said the words “fascist” and “racist” describe him very or somewhat well.\nPrevious surveys have consistently reported low approval ratings for Trump from Jewish voters, who have leaned heavily Democratic for decades. The poll found that a large majority of respondents plan to support Democrats in next year’s midterm elections.\nBut the “antisemitic” description is notable because Trump campaigned on fighting antisemitism. Since he returned to office, his administration has taken a number of high-profile actions with the stated goal of fighting antisemitism, including pulling billions of dollars in funding from universities and seeking to deport foreign student activists.\nThe poll found that only a fraction of respondents thought those actions reduce antisemitism, while a much larger share said the actions increase antisemitism.\nForty-nine percent of respondents said the funding cuts to universities increased antisemitism, while 25% said the cuts reduce antisemitism, and 26% said they have no impact.\nSixty-one percent of respondents believed that the Trump administration arresting and deporting pro-Palestinian protesters increased antisemitism, while 20% said it reduces antisemitism and another 20% said it has no impact.\nOverall, 77% of Jewish voters are concerned about antisemitism on college campuses, while even more are concerned about antisemitism in the United States more broadly.\nBut 64% disapprove of the job Trump is doing to combat antisemitism, while 36% approve.\n“Part of what’s going on is that Jewish voters believe that the actions that the Trump administration is taking, statements that the president is making, statements and actions of others in his administration, that these things actually increase antisemitism,” Jim Gerstein, a founding partner of GBAO Strategies, said in a briefing about the survey.\nHe said, “It is very striking that a lot of things that are being done in the name of combating antisemitism, Jews in America actually believe that these things increase antisemitism, instead of reduce antisemitism.”\nThe poll was conducted for a new nonpartisan group called the Jewish Voters Resource Center, which aims to collect and disseminate data on Jewish voters and issues. GBAO, which has done polls for liberal Jewish groups in the past, conducted the survey of 800 Jewish voters from April 22 to May 1. It has a margin of error of 3.5%.\nThe new data is being published two weeks after the conclusion of Trump’s first 100 days in office. It follows on the heels of a poll taken in late April by the Mellman Group that found 72% of American Jews disapproved of Trump’s job performance.\nWednesday’s poll also found that 74% of Jewish voters disapprove of the job Donald Trump is doing on foreign policy, while 26% approve. The poll found the same split when it comes to Trump’s proposal to transfer Palestinians in Gaza to Arab countries and have the United States take control of Gaza. Majorities also opposed a range of other Trump policies not directly tied to Israel or Jewish issues.\nThe poll also found that 92% of Jewish voters think that someone can be critical of Israeli government policies and still be “pro-Israel.” It found that the share who said they were very or somewhat attached to Israel had declined from 82% before the October 7, 2023, attack to 69% now.\nThe poll found that only 34% of respondents have favorable views of Netanyahu, while 61% have unfavorable views of him. Meanwhile, 62% believe that he resumed the war in Gaza in March for personal political considerations as opposed to Israel’s national security considerations, and 38% believe the opposite.\nThe poll found that 72% of respondents also believe the resumed military action in Gaza makes it more likely for the hostages to be killed, and 28% say it makes them more likely to be released.\n“When Jews are looking at Israel and thinking about Israel, while they’re very attached to it, it’s very striking how negative the attitudes towards Netanyahu are,” said Gerstein.",

    "article": "A group of anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian protesters surrounded the building where Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar was holding a press conference for about 80 journalists in Japan on Wednesday morning, with some trying to break in, Sa’ar’s office reported.\nAt the conference, Sa’ar said Israel won’t accept threats from Iran and its regional proxies, and predicted the expansion of the Abraham Accords normalization agreements when the war in Gaza ends.\nIn a photo shared by Sa’ar’s spokesperson, one protester was seen holding a sign with the foreign minister’s face on it, labeled “war criminal” in both English and Japanese.\nSecurity personnel were also shown removing a protester who was shouting “genocide” while inside the building, in footage shared by Sa’ar’s office.\nPosting about the demonstration to his X social media account, Sa’ar wrote, “They didn’t succeed in silencing us today, and they won’t succeed in the future. The truth will win!”\nIsrael has been waging a massive military campaign against Hamas in Gaza since the terror group’s devastating invasion of southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people and saw 251 abducted as hostages to the Strip. Israel sent a delegation to Doha this week for final attempts at a hostage-ceasefire release deal with the terror group before moving forward with an expanded ground invasion in the enclave.\nבמסיבת עיתונאים במועדון העתונות הלאומי בטוקיו,  בהשתתפות קרוב ל-80 עיתונאים, הצגתי את האמת שלנו. ״אמת אחת ולא שתיים, כשמש אחת וכשם שאין שתי ירושלים״ (אצ״ג). מפגינים פרו-פלסטינים ניסו להפריע ואף להתפרץ לארוע. הם לא הצליחו היום ולא יצליחו בעתיד להשתיק את הקול שלנו. האמת תנצח! pic.twitter.com/W6AocvsmCp\n— Gideon Sa'ar | גדעון סער (@gidonsaar) May 14, 2025\nThe Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 50,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though the toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7.\nIsrael insists it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.\nAs he spoke at the press conference, Sa’ar was informed of a Houthi missile attack on Israel, the third such assault from the Iran-backed Yemen rebels within 24 hours.\n“Millions of Israelis are now running to shelters, and this is happening as all the children are going to school or kindergartens,” he said. “This is daily life under these attacks. I believe this is a war crime. They are aiming at civilians.”\nThe Houthis have fired dozens of missiles and drones at Israel during the war in support of Gaza.\n“Since October 7, Israel has been attacked by the evil axis of Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and the Shia militias in Iraq,” Sa’ar said in a transcript of the meeting shared by his office. “We were attacked on seven fronts and we didn’t initiate on any of these fronts… we retaliated to the attacks.”\n“Israel aspires to expand the Abraham Accords and circle of peace and normalization in the Middle East. And we will do it when this war is over! But we cannot accept the ongoing threats to our security,” he added, referring to treaties signed during the first Trump administration that normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries.\n“Iran must be prevented from obtaining nuclear weapons. The international community must take firm action to make sure of this,” Sa’ar continued and added, “We thank Japan for its consistent and responsible approach in the International Atomic Energy Agency.”\nSa’r also thanked US President Donald Trump “for helping to secure the release of our soldier and dual Israeli-American citizen Edan Alexander” from Hamas captivity on Monday, in a deal struck between the US and Hamas, without Israel.\nSa’ar later met with Yoshimasa Hayashi, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary.\nHe told Hayashi that Israel and Japan both have “painful experience of hostages,” an apparent reference to a period of North Korean abductions from 1977 to 1983.\n“We appreciate the calls by Japan for the immediate release of our hostages,” Sa’ar said.\nHonored to meet Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi. Japan has its own painful experience with the issue of abductees taken by North Korea. We appreciate Japan's call for the immediate release of our 58 remaining hostages. We call and pray for the return of their… pic.twitter.com/Eka62kiaIn\n— Gideon Sa'ar | גדעון סער (@gidonsaar) May 14, 2025\nDuring their meeting, the two men spoke about bilateral ties and the situation in the Middle East. Sa’ar thanked Hayashi for Japan’s support for Israel and condemnation of the October 7 attack.\nSa’ar arrived in Japan on Tuesday on a first official visit to the G7 country by an Israeli foreign minister in 15 years, the Foreign Ministry announced at the time.\nOn Tuesday, he told Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya that Israel’s delegation to Doha this week will try “to reach a framework for the release of hostages, as we had sought from the beginning — based on the Witkoff framework,” a proposal attributed to US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff.\n“It is impossible to continue living alongside Hamas’s terror state… They continue to hold our hostages in order to dictate conditions that would allow them to continue their war against Israel,” he said.\nWitkoff also called on Japan to reject any unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, saying, “Unilateral steps against Israel will require an Israeli response. This would corner Israel. I call on Japan to reject such ideas, which would only push peace further away.”\nIran, “like Hamas… hold a fanatical religious ideology… After what they’ve already done… without nuclear weapons, one can only imagine what they would do if, God forbid, they got them. This must not be allowed,” Sa’ar told Iwaya.\nDuring his three-day visit, Sa’ar was also to meet with other top Japanese officials and members of the Japan-Israel Parliamentary friendship group, the Foreign Ministry said.\nIn October, Iwaya “unequivocally condemned” the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel but said he was “gravely concerned” by the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip one year into the ongoing conflict.\nThe foreign minister is expected to return to Israel on Thursday.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to Tokyo on May 12, 2014, in the last major diplomatic visit to Japan by an Israeli official.",

    "subheading": "For the 150,000-strong member Druze community, attacks against their brethren across the border cause concern and a commitment to strengthen their rights as Israeli citizens",
    "date": "Updated 12:36 PM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "YARKA — In her spacious living room, Samra Atalla served her guests freshly squeezed pomegranate juice, dates, and cookies as her phone beeped every few minutes with notifications from Syrian Druze friends and family members reporting on the community’s situation.\n“The Druze in Syria are in a tough place,” Atala, 58, told The Times of Israel last week in Yarka, a Druze village in the Western Galilee. “But we’re not going to abandon them.”\nViolent confrontations between the Druze and official Syrian security forces in Druze strongholds across Syria left some 100 people killed and scores wounded in recent weeks.\nIsrael has vowed to protect the Syrian Druze community, with the Israel Defense Forces recently striking targets in the country as a “warning” to the new regime. The IDF has also opened a temporary medical facility in southern Syria to treat wounded Druze after more than 30 injured were evacuated to Israeli hospitals.\nAtalla’s concern for the Druze in Syria is typical of the 150,000-member Druze community in Israel, which has organized protests and charity campaigns in an effort to protect the 700,000 or so Druze on the other side of the border.\nSince the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, Israel’s Druze have been demanding more for themselves as well. The fall of 13 Druze soldiers fighting against the terror groups Hamas and Hezbollah and the deaths of 12 Druze children in Majdal Shams in a Hezbollah rocket attack have prompted Druze in Israel to dig in deeper to protect their rights within the country while stressing their unique identity as a minority that has always been loyal to Israel.\nNow, with the violence against Druze inside Syria, their Israeli cousins are demanding that the government in Jerusalem defend their Syrian brethren.\n“Maybe God put the Druze here in Israel to save the Druze there,” Atalla said.\nSyria’s new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former member of an al-Qaeda-linked terror group who defeated Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December, has vowed that his new government will protect religious minorities. However, since his rule began, hundreds of Alawites — former Assad loyalists — have been killed, some of them by brutal executions.\nSyria is mostly settled by Sunni Muslims, and Druze make up about three percent of the population. The government is now run by Islamists, some of whom are linked to extremist groups.\nThe latest round of violence against the Druze began in March after a purported recording of a Druze man cursing the Prophet Mohammad circulated on social media.\nSheikh Muafak Tarif, the spiritual leader of the Israeli Druze community, said the clip was “a fake” while speaking at a conference on “The Druze and the Security of Israel: The blood alliance in practice” at Western Galilee College in Acre on May 5.\nTarif condemned what he called the world’s “silence” after Syrian security forces attacked Druze communities and warned: “After October 7 and what Hezbollah did, Israel cannot allow extremist terror groups to be on its northern border.”\nAlthough Druze representatives in a Damascus suburb recently signed an agreement with Syrian regime representatives according to which the Druze would hand over their heavy weapons and the regime’s security forces would be reinforced in the area, Atalla said she believes the deal is a “trick.”\nSharaa, who has tried to distance himself from the violent extreme Islamists, is “lying,” Atalla said.\nShe said even after the agreement, Islamic extremists shaved off Druze clerics’ mustaches to “humiliate” them. According to Syrian news sites, hundreds of Druze students have left universities in Damascus, Aleppo and Homs because of a sharp increase in violence.\nThe Druze are a mystic sect that broke away from Shiite Islam in the 11th century. There are approximately one million Druze in the world. Most live in Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Israel. Their religion is secret, but they consider the figures of Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Mohammed to be prophets. Druze do not accept converts.\nAtalla was born in Majdal Shams on the Golan Heights in 1966, the year before Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Six Day War. Israel annexed the area in 1981 and today, approximately 29,000 Druze live there, some 20% of whom have Israeli citizenship.\nFor years, Atalla ran a successful clothing store in Majdal Shams, learning the business in shops in Tel Aviv. She moved to Yarka after her marriage several years ago.\nAlthough she said there’s more security for the Druze in Israel, she’s still a “daughter of Syria.”\n“It doesn’t matter which government is in control of the area,” she said. “The most important thing is that we stay in our house, on our land.”\nA few miles away, in Tefen Industrial Park, Rabea Bader, 38, is helming the mic as the CEO & editor in chief of the North Radio station, 104.5 FM. The head of the first Hebrew-language radio program about Druze talked about the three basic principles of the community.\n“We don’t fight with people and treat others with respect until they threaten our honor, our religion or our land,” Bader said, as upbeat Mizrahi music was being broadcast from a sound room at the radio station.\nHe said that contrary to what the Israeli media has reported, there was “no massacre of the Druze because they have weapons, even heavy weapons, which they will not give up to al-Sharaa.”\n“He wears a suit and tries to show that he is liberal,” Bader said, “but the Druze won’t let him do to them what he did to the Alawites or what he might do to the Christians.”\n“The Druze in Syria are stronger than people realize. They will not let people hurt the things that are holy to them. They will defend themselves, even if it means losing their lives,” Bader said.\nBader and Lorena Kizel Khateeb, 28, a Druze journalist and social activist, are co-hosts of  “The Voice of the Druze,” which is broadcast each week on 104.5.\nOn the May 9 program, they hosted Reda Mansour, who had just retired from his position at the Israel Foreign Ministry after 35 years of service.\nSpeaking of the crisis in Syria, Mansour said that one of the challenges to unifying Syria is its lack of a coherent and cohesive Syrian identity. This, he said, is also a challenge facing Israel, which is composed of minorities and different religions and ethnic groups.\n“We don’t have a civil war, but we have to figure out how to create an Israeli identity” to guarantee Israel’s future, Mansour said.\nBader said that he served in the IDF and fought in the First Lebanon War in 2006.\n“I don’t have to prove my loyalty to the state,” he said. “I honor the flag and the anthem.”\nBut he does have a problem with the nation-state law, passed in 2018, which states that Israel is the “national home of the Jewish people.” The law is seen by the Druze community — as well as other non-Jewish minorities — as exclusionary.\n“The law defines me as a second-class citizen,” Bader said emphatically. “It implies that the country isn’t mine. But the truth is that I’m not a guest here. I’m also a landlord.”\nHe said that every day the law isn’t canceled is a “shame” for the state.\nKhateeb echoed Bader’s feelings in a phone conversation with The Times of Israel.\n“We are an inseparable part of Israeli society, contributing to it and being shaped by it,” she said. “We protest and criticize the country when necessary, and we don’t give up on our values. There are challenges and hardships we face — and there are certainly some — but we manage to thrive, stay true to ourselves, and live with pride.”\nOn the May 9 radio program, Khateeb said she recently received a phone message from a man in Syria who wrote her, “You are lucky to have been born in a country that respects you and who you are, regardless of your identity.”\nThe words moved her, she said, reminding her of “how truly fortunate we are to have been born in the State of Israel. In the year 2025, when people in Syria are being murdered because of their identity, we need to keep things in perspective. This is not something to take for granted.”",

    "date": "Updated 12:14 PM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "Some officers in the Israeli military have concluded that Gaza could face widespread starvation if the delivery of food aid is not restored in the coming weeks, The New York Times reported on Tuesday, citing three Israeli defense officials familiar with conditions in the Strip.\nIsrael Defense Forces officers who monitor the humanitarian situation have privately warned their commanders that, unless aid starts flowing again soon, parts of the Strip will have too little food to meet residents’ minimum daily nutritional needs, the report said.\nThe IDF officers stressed that resuming the flow of aid would take time, and that immediate steps must be taken to replenish supplies before they run out, according to the report.\nLast week, an IDF general briefed the cabinet on the humanitarian situation, telling political leaders that supplies would run out within weeks, the Times said, citing an Israeli defense official and a senior government official and echoing a previous report by Channel 13.\nIsrael cut off aid to Gaza on March 2, following the collapse of a hostage-ceasefire release deal, amid an effort to pressure the Hamas terror group into releasing more captives. Israel reportedly assessed that enough aid had already accumulated inside the Strip to last several months.\nIsrael has said it will resume the flow of aid, and Israeli and US officials have in recent days outlined a plan to control the distribution in order to avoid supplies being seized by Hamas. The model would see IDF troops securing the perimeter of aid distribution sites, with private, US-backed security contractors patrolling the sites themselves.\nMeanwhile the IDF has been gearing up for a planned major offensive in the Gaza Strip, which officials said would be launched if no hostage deal is reached with Hamas by the end of US President Donald Trump’s visit to the region on May 16.\nAccording to Israeli officials, the offensive would see the IDF “conquering” Gaza and retaining the territory, moving the Palestinian civilian population toward the south of the Strip, attacking Hamas, and preventing the terror group from taking control of humanitarian aid supplies.\nThe United Nations and international organizations have said they won’t cooperate with the planned US-Israeli aid initiative, which is to be managed by a new entity called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).\nA GHF memo, obtained by The Times of Israel last week, said that civilians in Gaza are currently “enduring extreme deprivation.”\nThe United Arab Emirates refused to bankroll the GHF’s plan, saying it failed to address the humanitarian crisis, a senior official familiar with the matter told The Times of Israel. A Western diplomat said the initiative was meant to be rolled out two weeks ago, but has faced a lack of international support.\nIn a statement, the UN and nonprofit groups alleged the GHF plan doesn’t sufficiently address the crisis and “weaponizes” aid.\nThe Trump administration, however, is pressuring international humanitarian organizations to cooperate with the new plan, threatening to slash their funding if they don’t, an Israeli official and a senior Western diplomat told The Times of Israel earlier this month.\nOn Monday, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) organization said “the Gaza Strip is still confronted with a critical risk of famine,” and that “the entire population is facing high levels of acute food insecurity, with half a million people [one in five] facing starvation.”\nCiting the report, UN World Food Programme executive director Cindy McCain said “families in Gaza are starving” and that it was “imperative” to get aid flowing again.\nA calculation by the WFP regarding the amount of aid currently waiting at the Gaza border and how long it would feed Gazans appeared to indicate, however, that the food that entered Gaza between January 19 and March 2 should suffice for the population’s needs until the middle of July.\nIsrael said in response that “even according to the IPC’s own analysis,” there is currently no famine in Gaza, and noted that previous IPC projections about impending famine have “repeatedly failed to materialize.”\nThe war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, when some 5,000 Hamas-led terrorists invaded southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Fifty-eight hostages — 23 believed to be alive, and the bodies of 35 confirmed dead — are still held by terror groups in the Strip, including a soldier killed in 2014.\nJeremy Sharon and Jacob Magid contributed to this report.",

    "article": "DUBAI — A British Bank of America analyst has been sentenced to a decade in a Saudi Arabian prison apparently over a since-deleted social media post, according to his lawyer.\nThe family of Ahmed al-Doush believes the charges against him stemmed from a deleted 2018 tweet about Sudan that did not mention Saudi Arabia, and his relationship with the son of a Saudi critic in exile, Amnesty International said in a statement Tuesday.\nSaudi Arabia’s press office and the United Kingdom’s Foreign Office didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nHe was sentenced Monday after being accused of violating terrorism and anti-cyber crime laws.\n“The exact tweet is unknown,” Haydee Dijkstal, al-Doush’s international counsel, posted Tuesday on X, the platform formerly called Twitter. “His trial and detention involved fair trial & due process violations. The UK Gov should stand firmly against a British national’s imprisonment for allegedly exercising his free speech rights.”\nThe 41-year-old British national was arrested in August at a Riyadh airport while trying to travel to Manchester, England, with his family. His wife has since given birth to their fourth child.\n“I rarely speak to my husband, but in the few snatched conversations we have managed, it is clear that Ahmed is struggling,” al-Doush’s wife, Amaher Nour, said ahead of her husband’s sentencing, citing his thyroid problems and distress after nine months of being jailed.\nThe developments came while US President Donald Trump was in Saudi Arabia, where several dual nationals with Western ties and Saudis have been detained in recent years over social media posts that could be viewed as critical to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto ruler.",

    "date": "Updated 09:54 AM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "PARIS, France (AFP) — Human Rights Watch on Wednesday said abuses were being committed on giant construction sites in Saudi Arabia and warned of the risks to migrant workers building stadiums for the 2034 soccer World Cup.\nHRW said “scores of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia die in gruesome yet avoidable workplace-related accidents, including falling from buildings, electrocution, and even decapitation.”\nThe organization, which has studied nearly 50 cases of deaths in Saudi Arabia, said Saudi authorities had “failed to adequately protect workers from preventable deaths, investigate workplace safety incidents, and ensure timely and adequate compensation for families” including through life insurance policies and benefits to survivors.\n“The risks of occupational deaths and injuries are further increasing as the Saudi government ramps up construction work for the 2034 World Cup as well as other ‘giga-projects,'” HRW added.\nThe Gulf kingdom was handed the right to host the 2034 World Cup at a FIFA Congress last December despite concerns about its human rights record, the risks to migrant laborers, and the criminalization of same-sex relationships. It was the only candidate.\nThe rights group called on FIFA to ensure all work-related deaths in Saudi Arabia are properly investigated and that bereaved families receive compensation.\nAccording to HRW, FIFA said it plans to establish a workers’ welfare system “dedicated to mandatory standards and enforcement mechanisms for World Cup-related construction and service delivery in Saudi Arabia.”\nBut football’s world governing body did not provide “details on concrete measures to prevent, investigate, and compensate migrant worker deaths such as risk-based heat protection measures or life insurance.”\nHRW claimed “FIFA is knowingly risking yet another tournament that will unnecessarily come at a grave human cost,” referencing the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.\nSimilar concerns over workers’ welfare dogged Qatar ahead of its hosting of the tournament.\nAmnesty International and other rights groups claimed thousands of migrant workers died in the lead-up to the 2022 tournament, though Doha has said only 37 workers on World Cup projects perished — and only three in work-related accidents.\nHRW stated in its report that the majority of migrant worker deaths in Saudi Arabia are attributed to “natural causes” and are therefore neither investigated nor compensated.\nAccording to figures provided by the group, for example, 74 percent of 1,420 Indian migrant worker deaths recorded at the Indian embassy in Riyadh in 2023 were attributed to natural causes.\nHRW added “even work-related death cases categorized as such in a migrant worker’s death certificate are sometimes not compensated as they should be according to Saudi law and international labour standards.”\n“In migrant death cases that are compensated, the process is long and burdensome,” the report said, providing an example of one such compensation process that took a decade to be completed.\n“My sons are 11 and 13 years old. When my husband died, they were 11 months and two years old. If we had received compensation right after his death, it would have provided so much relief,” the wife of a deceased worker, who was not named, told HRW.",

    "article": "Prominent right-wing influencers Ben Shapiro, Laura Loomer, and Mark Levin have rebuked US President Trump for his willingness to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet as a gift from the ruling family of Qatar.\nTheir criticism shows a rare crack in Trump’s Make America Great Again movement, which takes a more isolationist stance than traditional Republicans and criticizes their willingness to intervene in world affairs in support of allies like Ukraine and Israel.\n“Taking sacks of goodies from people who support Hamas, Muslim Brotherhood, al-Jazeera, all the rest — that’s not America first,” said Shapiro, who lit a torch in Israel’s Independence Day ceremony last month, on his podcast this week.\nLoomer tweeted that she would “take a bullet” for Trump but pointed out what she said was a contradiction between his accepting a gift from Qatar and his policy agenda.\n“How are we supposed to ever see the US under the Trump admin designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization if the US is now going to accept a $400 million jet from Qatar to fly the US President and his staff around on?” she wrote.\nLoomer noted that Trump had signed an executive order last month requiring US educational institutions to disclose the source of their funding as a means to combat foreign influence.\nLevin said Qatar’s money should not give it influence.\n“Their jet and all the other things they are buying in our country does not provide them with the cover they seek,” he tweeted.\nThe Qatari government said Tuesday that a final decision hadn’t been made on the move. Trump defended the idea — which would amount to a US president accepting an astonishingly valuable gift from a foreign government — as a fiscally smart move for the country.\nTrump intends to convert the Qatari aircraft into a plane he can fly on as president, with the US Air Force planning to add secure communications and other classified elements to it, but it will have more limited capabilities than the existing planes that were built to serve as Air Force One, the Associated Press reported.\nTrump’s political rivals have bashed him for the potential gift, with Democrats demanding an investigation into the transaction. Many of his supporters have expressed mild criticism but emphasized they remain loyal to the president, Axios reported.",

Preceding the sirens by some four minutes, an early warning was issued to residents, alerting them of the long-range missile attack via a push notification on their phones.\nShortly afterward, the Israel Defense Forces repeated an “urgent” evacuation warning for three Houthi-controlled ports in Yemen, ahead of possible airstrikes.\nWednesday morning’s missile attack followed two missile attacks the previous day.\nOn Tuesday evening, a missile triggered sirens in central Israel and Jerusalem and was intercepted by air defenses. No one was directly wounded, but two people were injured while rushing to shelters.\nSeveral hours later on Tuesday, another ballistic missile launched from Yemen, apparently aimed at Israel, fell short far from the country, according to an Israeli defense source. The military identified the launch, but no sirens sounded in Israel because the missile did not pose a threat.\nA missile fired from Yemen also fell short of the country on Monday, a defense source said.\nThe attacks came a week after Israel carried out two days of heavy sorties targeting infrastructure controlled by the Houthis in response to a missile that struck inside the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport. After the airport was hit, most foreign airlines suspended flights to Israel.\nOn Sunday, the IDF issued an “urgent” evacuation warning to the three Houthi-controlled ports in western Yemen, though no strikes were reported to follow.\nShortly after Wednesday’s missile attack, Adraee repeated the warning, saying, “Due to the Houthi terror regime’s use of ports for its terror activities, we urge all those present at these ports to evacuate and stay away from them for your own safety until further notice.”\n#عاجل تحذير مهم ومتكرر لكل المتواجدين في الموانئ البحرية التي يسيطر عليها النظام الحوثي الإرهابي⭕️ميناء رأس عيسى⭕️ميناء الحديدة⭕️ميناء الصليف\n????نحثكم على اخلاء هذه الموانئ حتى إشعار آخر????\nنظرًا لقيام النظام الحوثي الإرهابي باستخدام الموانئ البحرية لصالح أنشطته الإرهابية نحث… pic.twitter.com/sqdQhvVdWt\n— افيخاي ادرعي (@AvichayAdraee) May 14, 2025\nThe Houthis — whose slogan calls for “Death to America, Death to Israel, [and] a Curse on the Jews” — began attacking Israel and maritime traffic in November 2023, a month after the October 7 Hamas massacre.\nThe Houthis held their fire when a ceasefire was reached between Israel and Hamas in January 2025. By that point, they had fired over 40 ballistic missiles and dozens of attack drones and cruise missiles at Israel, including one that killed a civilian and wounded several others in Tel Aviv in July, prompting Israel’s first strike in Yemen.\nSince March 18, when the IDF resumed its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis in Yemen have launched 33 ballistic missiles and at least 10 drones at Israel. Several of the missiles have fallen short.\nThe sirens warning of missile attacks have sent hundreds of thousands of Israelis rushing to shelters at all hours of the day and night.\nBoth Israel and the US have struck Houthi targets in Yemen in response to the attacks.\nEarlier this month, however, US President Donald Trump announced that the US would stop bombing Houthi targets in exchange for the group ceasing its attacks on important shipping lanes. The truce did not involve Israel, which the Houthis have continued attacking.\nTimes of Israel staff contributed to this report.",

    "article": "CANNES, France (AP) — One hundred years after Charlie Chaplin made dinner rolls dance and ate his shoe like it was a fine meal, “The Gold Rush” has been vividly brought back to life in a new restoration that premiered Tuesday at the Cannes Film Festival.\nOn the opening day of its 78th edition, Cannes debuted a 4K restoration of “The Gold Rush,” one of Chaplin’s most beloved silent masterpieces. The screening, held just before the festival’s official opening ceremony, was part of a new day-one tradition for restored films, festival director Thierry Fremaux said before the screening at Cannes’ Debussy Theatre.\nYears in the making, this “Gold Rush” pristinely restores Chaplin’s Tramp to all his downtrodden glory. The 1925 Alaskan frontier comedy may be marking its centenary, but it looks bracingly fresh in the restoration carried out by La Cineteca di Bologna.\nThe restoration was more complicated than most because it included an extensive search for any missing footage. In 1942, Chaplin edited the film and re-released it with sound effects, music and narration. That version landed two Oscar nominations, but the restoration sought to get as close to the 1925 original as possible.\nIn “The Gold Rush” Chaplin’s lone prospector ambles through the snowy Alaskan wilds in pursuit less of gold than some food and perhaps companionship. His antic, cliff-dangling struggles make up much of the film’s deft slapstick, but the Little Tramp’s humble, sweet hopes for romance greatly exceed his strike-it-rich ambitions.\nThe film’s premiere drew two grandchildren of Chaplin: Kiera Chaplin and Spencer Chaplin.\n“What to say about ‘The Gold Rush?’ said Spencer Chaplin. “It was his biggest production to date. He built the set — it was almost like a tourist attraction in LA at the time. He built the mountains.”\nThe screening in Cannes drew a packed house in one of Cannes’ largest theaters, a crowd that the Chaplin descendants warmly surveyed.\n“Our grandfather would be really proud to see this, a hundred years later, to see all you here and interested in seeing the film,” said Kiera Chaplin.\n“The Gold Rush” will roll out in theaters worldwide on June 26 in a release organized by mk2 Films.",

    "article": "CANNES, France — The Cannes film festival kicked off Tuesday with a highly political ceremony that included a tribute to a slain Palestinian photojournalist from Juliette Binoche and a fresh attack on US President Donald Trump from Robert De Niro.\nBinoche, who heads this year’s Cannes jury that will award the Palme d’Or top prize, lamented the death of Gaza photographer Fatima Hassouna to the star-studded audience.\nHassouna, 25, was killed in an Israeli airstrike last month along with her family, a day after a documentary about her was selected to premiere at Cannes.\n“She should have been here tonight with us,” an emotional Binoche said, adding that “in every region of the world, artists are fighting every day and make resistance into art.”\nShe also briefly referenced the Israeli hostages taken by Palestinian terrorist group Hamas in its October 7, 2023, assault on Israel, which sparked the Gaza war.\nOn the eve of the festival, more than 380 film insiders including “Schindler’s List” actor Ralph Fiennes and former Cannes-winning directors said they were “ashamed” of their industry’s failure to speak out about Israel’s siege of Gaza.\n“We cannot remain silent while genocide is taking place in Gaza,” read a letter initiated by several pro-Palestinian activist groups and published in French newspaper Liberation and US magazine Variety.\nThe signatories — who include Hollywood stars Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon, Spanish director Pedro Almodovar and former Cannes winners Ruben Ostlund, Mike Leigh, Justine Triet and Costa-Gavras — also denounced the death of Hassouna.\nShe was killed along with 10 relatives in an Israeli strike on her family home in northern Gaza. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the strike targeted a Hamas operative involved in attacks on soldiers and civilians.\n“Prior to the strike, measures were taken to minimize the risk to civilians, including the use of precision munitions, aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence,” it said at the time, while accusing Hamas of “systematically violating international law, while cynically and brutally using the population as a human shield for terror activity.”\nDe Niro was guest of honor at the opening ceremony, receiving an honorary Palme d’Or award for his contribution to cinema from fellow actor and occasional co-star Leonardo DiCaprio.\nThe 81-year-old is one of the most outspoken critics of Trump in American cinema, with the “Taxi Driver” star often aiming harsh words at the US president.\nThe veteran actor said that “in my country we are fighting like hell for democracy” against a “philistine president.”\nHe slammed Trump’s plans for 100-percent tariffs on films “produced in foreign lands” which the Republican leader announced on May 5.\n“You can’t put a price on creativity. But apparently, you can put a tariff on it,” De Niro said. “Of course, all these attacks are unacceptable. This is not just an American problem, it is a global one.”\nTrump’s idea sent shockwaves through the film world, although few insiders or experts understand how the policy can be implemented.\nCannes director Thierry Fremaux has talked up the festival’s “rich” American film program, with movies from Wes Anderson, Richard Linklater, Ari Aster and Kelly Reichardt in the main competition.\nFormer Cannes winner Quentin Tarantino declared the festival open.\nHe posed for photos on the red carpet with his Israeli wife Daniella Pick, who wore a yellow ribbon as a tribute to the 251 hostages taken by Hamas in 2023.\nDaniella Never forgets : Danielle Pick , The Israeli wife of  Quentin Tarantino walked with him on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival , wearing the hostages pinHope they all come home soon  ????️????️r/t @RazShechnik pic.twitter.com/RDME6bLyez\n— Iris (@streetwize) May 13, 2025\nTuesday’s opening gala was also a first test of the festival’s new dress code which prohibits excessively large dresses and “total nudity.”\nJury member Halle Berry said she had been forced to leave a gown she had chosen for the opening night by Indian designer Gaurav Gupta in her wardrobe.\n“I cannot wear it because the train is too big,” the Oscar winner told reporters.\nOthers openly flouted the restrictions. German model Heidi Klum sported a pink train at least three meters (10 feet) long, while Chinese actor and influencer Wan Qianhui appeared in an enormous mountain of white taffeta.\nThe opening film was musical drama “Leave One Day” by newcomer French director Amelie Bonnin, who became the first debut director to be granted the prestigious slot.\nTom Cruise is to return to the Riviera for the premiere of the latest installment of his “Mission: Impossible” franchise on Wednesday, three years after attending the festival for “Top Gun: Maverick.”\nThe festival opened hours after a Paris court rocked the film world by convicting legendary actor Gerard Depardieu for sexual harassment and handing him an 18-month suspended prison sentence.\nThe 76-year-old, who has acted in more than 200 films and television series, is the highest-profile figure caught up in France’s response to the #MeToo movement against sexual violence.",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said he would attend the talks if Putin were present.\nAn order issued by Putin on the Kremlin website said the delegation included two officials who took part in the last set of talks held between the two sides in the first weeks following Russia’s 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbor.\nThose included presidential adviser Vladimir Medinsky and Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin.\nAlso named as part of the delegation was Igor Kostyukov, director of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the GRU, Russia’s Foreign Military Intelligence Agency. Kostyukov was identified in the Kremlin announcement as Chief of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces.\nDeputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin was also named as part of the delegation.\nNegotiators held several rounds of talks in 2022 first in Belarus and then in Turkey, but the negotiations eventually broke down.\nThe Gaza Humanitarian Foundation announces that it would launch operations in the Gaza Strip before the end of the month, adding that Israel has agreed to expand the number of “Secure Distribution Sites” in order to serve the enclave’s entire population, according to a statement.\nIn a letter to the Israeli government, the foundation’s executive director, Jake Wood, requested that Israel facilitate the flow of enough aid using existing modalities to Gaza until it is fully operational.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemns the “horrific” shooting by a Palestinian terrorist on several Israeli vehicles in the West Bank this evening, which the IDF said wounded a man and his pregnant wife.\n“I am deeply shocked by the horrific attack in Samaria against a woman in advanced pregnancy and her husband, as they were on their way to the delivery room,” writes Netanyahu in a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, referring to the northern West Bank where the shooting took place.\n“I trust that our security forces will, in this case as in others, quickly reach the murderers and hold them and all who aided them to account,” concludes the statement.\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian says Iran will not “bow to any bully” in response to US President Donald Trump’s criticism of Tehran during his Gulf tour.\n“He (Trump) thinks he can come here, chant slogans and scare us. For us, martyrdom is far sweeter than dying in bed. You came to frighten us? We will not bow to any bully,” he says in comments broadcast live on state TV.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says in a video statement that he is “making all the efforts” to return the hostages alongside the aim of applying military pressure on Hamas.\nWhile exiting the military’s Kirya headquarters in Tel Aviv this evening, Netanyahu says, “I’m leaving from here to meet with the US ambassador. We are making all the efforts, including throughout today, to bring the release of our hostages and to achieve the goals of our war.”\n“We are not giving up on anyone,” he adds.\nAsked to respond to reports that the hostage issue is not a primary concern of the premier or his government, Netanyahu replies that, “I stopped my trial today” in order to “take two hours this afternoon to speak with [US special envoy to the Mideast Steve] Witkoff in Doha — because I asked to send a delegation to Doha in order to try and progress the release of our hostages.”\n“So they are at the forefront of my mind, they are there, together with the combined objectives of military pressure,” he continues.\n“And also on all of these things I spoke continuously about today at the Kirya. That’s what we’re doing, hours upon hours, and now I am going, like I said, to continue the job, in Jerusalem,” says the premier.\nAccording to an initial IDF probe of the attack near Bruchin, several Israeli vehicles came under fire. In one car, a man and his pregnant wife were seriously wounded.\nThe IDF has dispatched troops and an Israeli Air Force drone for the manhunt for the terrorist who carried out the shooting. Troops have also blocked the entrance to the adjacent Palestinian town of Bruqin.\nBeilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva says the condition of a man wounded in a shooting attack on a West Bank highway has been updated to lightly hurt after he was initially listed as seriously wounded.\nThere are no immediate updates from the hospital on the pregnant woman who was critically hurt in the terror shooting.\nThe woman wounded in the shooting attack near the West Bank settlement of Bruchin is in the late stages of pregnancy, according to first responders.\nShe was taken to a hospital in critical condition, along with a man in serious condition.\nWhile attending a state dinner in Qatar, US President Donald Trump repeats his desire for a peaceful resolution to Iran’s nuclear program, and suggests the ball is in Tehran’s court.\n“The non-friendly is a violent course and I don’t want that.” He adds that “it’s their decision.”\nHe urges Qatar to help reach an agreement.\n“It’s a perilous situation, and we want to do the right thing,” he says. “We want to do something that’s going to save maybe millions of lives. Because things like that get started and they get out of control.”\nUS President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, has laid out a new plan during hostage negotiations in Doha for a deal to release all or almost all of the hostages in Gaza, end the war, and remove Hamas from power in the Gaza Strip, according to a Channel 12 news report.\nWhile mediators have expressed support for the plan, and Hamas has “sent positive signals,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is insisting on a limited deal that does not require Israel to end its military campaign in Gaza, says the report.\nIt notes that Witkoff and Netanyahu spoke by phone earlier today.\n“The Americans have an attitude of ‘take it or leave it,’ or we’re gone. They are determined that whoever doesn’t go with them will lose a lot,” a senior Israeli official aware of the discussions told Channel 12.\nIn recordings aired this evening by the network, Witkoff is heard telling the hostages’ families yesterday in Tel Aviv that, “Statistically, many more hostages than not have come out through diplomatic means, that’s what’s really worked. The Israeli military has had success, they have, but more often than not, dialogue and diplomacy have really worked here.”\nMeanwhile, unnamed ministers in the Israeli security cabinet told Channel 12 today that “this cabinet approved [Israel’s planned expanded Gaza ground invasion] in the case that Hamas does not agree to release additional hostages in the [original] Witkoff framework. The prime minister will be judged by us based on how firmly he stands up to the pressure from Trump.”\nThe original Witkoff framework would see a temporary ceasefire of some 40 days, in exchange for about half of the remaining living hostages.\nThe IDF says it has launched a manhunt for a Palestinian terrorist who opened fire on Israeli motorists in the West Bank this evening, near the settlement of Bruchin.\nA woman in her 30s is being treated in critical condition at the scene, and a man in his 30s is being taken to a hospital in serious condition, Magen David Adom says.\nBoth victims of the suspected terror attack near the West Bank settlement of Bruchin are listed in serious condition, Magen David Adom says.\nThe pair came under fire on Route 446 between Bruchin and Pedu’el.\nThe IDF says it is responding to the incident.\nThe IDF says it has received reports of gunfire near the West Bank settlement of Bruchin.\nFurther details are under investigation, it adds.\nFirst responders say two people, a man and a woman, were injured by the gunfire.\nJordan carried out a medical evacuation of four child cancer patients and 12 of their family members from Gaza to the Hashemite kingdom earlier today, a Jordanian official tells The Times of Israel.\nThis follows King Abdullah’s announcement during a February meeting with US President Donald Trump that Jordan would take in 2,000 child cancer patients from Gaza, as Washington sought to push countries in the region to facilitate the emigration of Palestinians from the war-torn Strip.\nThe total number of cancer patients taken in by Jordan now stands at 33, after 29 were medically evacuated in March along with 44 family members.\nThe slow pace and small number of evacuations have reportedly been a point of tension for US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. and Democratic House Representative Nancy Pelosi, who have both raised their frustration with Jordanian counterparts.\nPolitico reported that Jordanian officials in response noted that Israel was refusing to commit to allowing those who leave to return upon completion of their treatment, leaving family members unable to reunite with their loved ones.\nThe Israeli stance has significantly hampered efforts to find countries to take Gazans, particularly given increasing comments from government officials in Jerusalem about plans to permanently occupy the Strip and build settlements in places where Palestinians once lived.\nThe Jordanian official tells The Times of Israel that Amman is still committed to meeting Abdullah’s pledge to Trump, despite the challenges.\n“Jordan wanted to evacuate all the children from Gaza by air, but Israeli authorities didn’t agree,” the Jordanian official says, adding that the evacuations took place by land, with patients being driven into Israel and then through the West Bank before reaching Jordan.\nThe transport through Israel ostensibly required the cooperation of Israeli authorities, but a separate Jordanian statement only mentions cooperation with the World Health Organization.\nAfter Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called Israel a “genocidal state” while speaking in the Spanish parliament, saying that Madrid “does not do business” with such a country, the Foreign Ministry has summoned the Spanish ambassador to Israel for a dressing down.\n“Following the severe remarks made by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, the Spanish Ambassador to Israel has been summoned for a reprimand meeting at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem tomorrow,” writes the Foreign Ministry in a statement.\nPedro Sánchez: \"Nosotros no comerciamos con un estado genocida\". pic.twitter.com/XJz3qoCuRM\n— Isaac (@isaacrrr7) May 14, 2025\nLAS VEGAS — A Las Vegas man who made antisemitic threats against Nevada US Senator Jacky Rosen and her family has been sentenced to just under four years in federal prison.\nRosen, a Democrat, is Jewish and has maintained a vocal pro-Israel stance. Rosen’s office previously confirmed that she and her family were targeted.\nJohn Anthony Miller, 44, is sentenced to 46 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. He pleaded guilty in December to one count of threatening a federal official and other charges. Prosecutors say Miller also made threats against the family of another unnamed US senator.\nIn October 2023, Miller made several threatening calls and left a series of threatening voicemails containing antisemitic slurs to Rosen. In some of them, he referenced the Israel-Hamas war and the Holocaust, according to prosecutors.\nMiller also went to a federal courthouse in Las Vegas, looking for Rosen, but he was turned away after refusing to provide identification, prosecutors said. Outside the courthouse, he shouted threats against Israelis. He was arrested a week later and has been in custody ever since.\nJess Marchese, Miller’s lawyer, says Miller struggles with a drug addiction and was high on methamphetamine at the time of the crimes.\n“I felt the sentence was a little harsh for a nonviolent offender with a minimal criminal record, but we respect the court’s ruling and look forward to John moving forward and dealing with his addiction,” Marchese says in a text to The Associated Press.\nAP also emails Rosen’s office. At the time of Miller’s arrest, a spokesperson for Rosen’s office said in a statement that threats against public officials should be taken seriously.\nQatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari says that the release of the hostage soldier from Hamas captivity in Gaza, Edan Alexander, has brought a new push to the negotiation efforts regarding the war in Gaza.\nIn an interview with the Qatari Al-Araby channel, Al-Ansari adds that all the meetings held in Qatar today took place within the framework of this momentum and the new proposal, as he put it, in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\nHe also says that Qatar is working with mediators Egypt and the United States to bridge the gap between the sides.\nThe United States says it will pursue sanctions against any country, group or person that provides fuel, war material or other resources to Yemen’s Houthi rebels.\nLast week, Trump announced that the US would halt its strikes on the Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group that agreed to stop its attacks on American vessels in the Red Sea.\nActing US Ambassador Dorothy Shea tells a UN Security Council meeting that Iran has enabled Houthi attacks “with military, logistical and intelligence support.”\n“This council must not tolerate Iranian defiance of its resolutions and should impose consequences on sanctions violators using the tools at its disposal,” she says.\nA group of over 65 freed hostages signs onto a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other government ministers urging Israel to resume negotiations for a deal to free all the hostages, citing the “historic momentum” created by the release of Edan Alexander.\n“We believe the Israeli government now faces a genuine opportunity to return to the negotiating table. We urge all those involved in this process: Please do not walk away until a comprehensive deal is signed,” the ex-captives write. “The majority of Israeli society wants the hostages home — even at the cost of halting military operations. They believe in the sanctity of human life and the paramount importance of bringing the fallen back for proper burial in Israel.”\n“Having endured Hamas’s tunnels ourselves, we call upon US President Donald Trump, the prime minister, government ministers and all those engaged in these negotiations: Do not let this historic momentum stop,” they add.\nThey also call to “free all our brothers and sisters from their nightmare, regardless of which citizenship they hold.”\n“Only the immediate return of ALL hostages through a negotiated deal will create the foundation for hope, unity, and the renewal of our nation,” the former hostages add.\nDAMASCUS, Syria — Syrian Finance Minister Yisr Barnieh makes a call to global investors to come do business with Syria after US President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement that he would lift all of Washington’s sanctions on the country.\n“Syria today is a land of opportunities, with immense potential across every sector– from agriculture to oil, tourism, infrastructure and transportation,” Barnieh says in an interview with Reuters at the finance ministry in Damascus.\n“We envision a central role for the private sector in the new Syrian economy. The finance ministry’s role is not to spend indiscriminately or act as a regulatory enforcer over businesses, but rather to enable and support growth.”\nThe UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) says direct fire from the Israeli army hit the perimeter of one of its peacekeeping positions in south Lebanon.\nIn a statement, UNIFIL says the incident yesterday was the first of its kind since Israel and Iran-backed Lebanese terror group Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire last November.\nThere is no immediate comment from the Israeli army.\nPalestinian media reports fresh Israeli strikes near the European Hospital in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, where yesterday the IDF targeted Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar.\nThe strikes appear to be an attempt by the IDF to prevent anyone from approaching a tunnel beneath the medical center where Sinwar was targeted.\nمتابعة| سلسلة غارات إسرائيلية عنيفة تستهدف محيط مستشفى غزة الأوروبي شرقي خانيونس، جنوب قطاع غزة. pic.twitter.com/l5CWvQe2p1\n— المركز الفلسطيني للإعلام (@PalinfoAr) May 14, 2025\nThe IDF has not yet confirmed if Sinwar was killed in the strike, and is also looking into the possibility that other senior Hamas officials were potentially with him.\nBERLIN — Germany wants to see the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including Germans, brought back alive and Israel should consider this in its military actions in the strip, Chancellor Friedrich Merz says.\nAsked whether Germany would implement an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Merz says that in principle it should be possible for an Israeli premier to visit Germany.\nHow this could happen would be clarified when necessary, he says at the joint press conference with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in Berlin, adding that no bilateral visits by him or Netanyahu are currently planned.\nMerz says future financial support for UNRWA, the United Nations’ agency for Palestinian refugees, is conditional on the organization being reformed.\nGuterres, who is meeting Merz in Berlin, calls for a Gaza ceasefire and “unimpeded humanitarian access” to the Palestinian territory.\n“In relation to Gaza, I reiterate my call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, unimpeded humanitarian access and an immediate cessation of hostilities allowing for an irreversible path towards a two-state solution,” Guterres says.\nAgreements signed by US President Donald Trump and Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani will “generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion,” the White House says in a fact sheet summarizing some of the deals’ details.\nThe agreements include a $96 billion deal with Qatar Airways to buy up to 210 Boeing 787 Dreamliner and 777X airplanes with GE Aerospace engines, the fact sheet says. They also include a statement of intent that could lead to $38 billion in investments at Qatar’s Al Udeid Air Base and other air defense and maritime security capabilities, it says.\nIDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir met with reservists this morning at the Tze’elim training base in southern Israel, where troops are preparing for a planned major offensive in the Gaza Strip.\n“I am aware of the gravity of the task, the responsibility, and the burden that we place on you and your families. We do so with reverence. The only consideration before my eyes is the security of the country,” Zamir says in remarks published by the IDF.\nThe IDF releases a recording of Golani commander Col. Adi Ganon phoning Edan Alexander, who served in the infantry brigade’s 51st Battalion, to fete his release from Hamas captivity in Gaza.\n“I am so happy to see you, all the brigade is here, we waited for you all the time, up to now,” Ganon is heard telling Alexander. “It was very important for me to personally call you, to embrace you from afar.”\n“We are really, really happy you are again with us. You are part of the family, even in the tough moments, even now. A true hero who returned to us,” Ganon adds, telling Alexander that “the strength you displayed throughout this time inspires us.”\nAlexander, in turn, tells Ganon that he’s “doing fine.”\n“I’m weak, but rehabilitating. With the help of God it’s just [a matter of] time,” he says.\nThe IDF issues an evacuation warning for Palestinians in several schools and a hospital in Gaza City’s Rimal neighborhood, saying that Hamas is exploiting the civilian sites for terror.\n“Due to the Hamas terror organization exploiting civilian areas for terror activities, as shown in the attached image, the IDF will attack the area with great force,” warns the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesman, Col.

This is the seventh time that judges have extended Keshet’s remand.\nKeshet is also suspected of obstructing the investigation and breach of trust, amid suspicions that he used another city hall worker to silence the women who complained about him.\nIn March, Channel 12 news interviewed the municipal worker, who was later questioned by police, as well as five women who claimed they were assaulted by Keshet.\nKeshet’s attorney at the time said in a statement to the outlet that his client completely denies that he committed any offense.\nOTTAWA — New Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand accuses Israel of using a lack of food as a political tool in its Gaza operation and urges further work on a ceasefire with Hamas, the terror group that controls the Palestinian enclave.\nIsrael has sealed off the Gaza Strip since early March and resumed its military campaign against Hamas following the collapse of a ceasefire deal during which thousands of aid trucks entered the enclave.\n“We cannot allow the continued use of food as a political tool.. Over 50,000 people have died as a result of the aggression caused against the Palestinians and the Gazan people in Palestine. Using food as a political tool is simply unacceptable,” Anand tells reporters ahead of a cabinet meeting.\n“We need to continue to work towards a ceasefire. We need to ensure that we have a two-state solution, and Canada will continue to maintain that position.”\nLONDON — Three British right-wing extremists are convicted of planning to carry out a terrorist attack at mosques or synagogues as part of a “race war,” British police say.\nBrogan Stewart and Marco Pitzettu, both 25, and Christopher Ringrose, 34, were preparing an act of terrorism when they were arrested in February 2024, prosecutors said at the start of their trial in March.\nThe trio were also each charged with two counts of collecting information which may be useful to someone preparing an act of terrorism, while Ringrose was charged with manufacturing a component for a 3D-printed FGC9 firearm.\nThey pleaded not guilty but jurors at Sheffield Crown Court today convict them of all charges. They will be sentenced on July 17.\n“Stewart, Pitzettu, and Ringrose have today been rightfully convicted of multiple terrorism offenses,” Detective Chief Superintendent James Dunkerley, Head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, says in a statement.\n“They were a group that espoused vile racist views and advocated for violence, all to support their extreme right-wing mindset.\n“Some of their defense in court was that it was all fantasy or just part of harmless chat, however all three took real-world steps to plan and prepare for carrying out an attack on innocent citizens.”\nProsecutor Jonathan Sandiford had told jurors that the three defendants expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler and perpetrators of notorious terrorist attacks, as well as hatred for non-white people, especially Muslims and immigrants.\n“It was their belief that there must soon come a time when there would be a race war between the white and other races,” Sandiford says.\nROME — Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni says the humanitarian situation in Gaza is “ever more dramatic and unjustifiable,” stressing she has repeatedly urged Israel to find a way to end the conflict.\n“It is a request that I renew today in the face of a humanitarian situation in Gaza that I have no difficulty in defining as increasingly dramatic and unjustifiable,” Meloni tells parliament.\nQatar signs a deal to purchase jets from US manufacturer Boeing for Qatar Airways during US President Donald Trump’s visit to the Gulf Arab country.\nTrump says the deal is worth $200 billion and included 160 jets.

A new heatwave is set to hit Israel on Friday and Saturday.\nOn May 1, a fire in the area between Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh burned 20,000 dunams (5,000 acres), forcing several communities to evacuate and closing the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway and other roads for hours.\nOn Tuesday, the Fire and Rescue Authority issued an appeal to local authorities asking to ban bonfires in open areas between May 9 and May 18.\nFirst Sgt. Igor Pibenev, who killed over a dozen Hamas terrorists during the October 7, 2023, invasion of southern Israel, took his own life last night.\nHis funeral will be held this evening at 6 p.m. at the Ashkelon Cemetery. He leaves behind a wife and three daughters.\nUpon hearing about the October 7 Hamas attack, Pibenev left the police station in Hebron and drove to his home in Yated, a moshav near the Gaza border. On the way there, he killed at least 13 Hamas terrorists.\nPibenev encountered the first two gunmen near Urim Junction. He stopped his car after hearing the sound of bullets, then identified and shot the pair dead. Minutes later, two others began to shoot at him, embroiling him in a quick gunfight.\n“After I saw them fall and not move, I returned to my car and continued to travel,” he said in an interview to the police spokesperson’s office. He went on to kill nine others, several who were heading toward Nir Yitzhak.\nAfter reuniting with his family in Yated, he went out again to join up with the moshav’s volunteer security team.\n“We had trained for scenarios like this, but I never imagined we’d face such a large number of terrorists,” he said.\nPibenev’s death was announced on social media. Three months ago, his wife, Hani Liderman-Pibenev, posted about the “silent victims of October 7,” referring to those struggling with survivor’s guilt and PTSD following the massacre.\n“If there are people around you who have been deteriorating since that Shabbat, turn the world upside down to make sure they get professional help and proper treatment.

We saw the destroyed art gallery… We promised to help to rebuild this place.”\n“Yet we are further away from the future than we would wish,” he continues, saying, “The kibbutz is not yet inhabited, the wounds are deep… 585 days after the massacre, there are still hostages in the hands of Hamas, including German companions… Germany will not forget them, and I will not forget them.

President Macron should not lecture us on morality,” Katz says in a statement.\nMacron, speaking yesterday in an interview with TF1 television, accused Netanyahu of blocking aid into the Strip and warned that Europe may reconsider its cooperation agreements with Israel. “My job is to do everything I can to make it stop,” Macron said.\nKatz responds that “it is expected that someone who considers himself a friend of Israel would stand by Israel in its war against the murderous terrorist organization Hamas and the Iranian axis of evil.”\n“The IDF operates with the highest level of morality under extremely difficult and complex circumstances — certainly more than anything France has done in its past wars,” he adds.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene a limited security meeting at 4:30 p.m. today with ministers and defense officials.\nWhile in Riyadh earlier today, US President Donald Trump tells the Gulf conference that he hopes for the “future of safety and dignity of the Palestinian people” in Gaza, but says that cannot happen under the Strip’s current leaders, Hamas, who he says “delight in raping, torturing and murdering innocent people.”\nHe says he “greatly appreciates” the role of the Gulf countries in trying to “bring this terrible conflict to an end, including securing the release of American hostage Edan Alexander.”\n“We thought Edan was dead,” he says, adding that “ultimately, all hostages of all nationalities must be released as a steppingstone to peace.”\n“We thought Edan was dead.”\nUS President Donald Trump says Hamas cannot pursue peace while delighting in terror, as he thanks Gulf leaders for helping secure the release of American hostage Edan Alexander.#US #Gaza #Palestine #SaudiArabia #GCC pic.twitter.com/rhqbRUmcYb\n— Al Arabiya English (@AlArabiya_Eng) May 14, 2025\nShortly after arriving in Doha, US President Donald Trump meets with Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, and praises the long friendship between the two.\n“We’ve been friends for a long time,” Trump says, additionally praising the marble in the room.\n“We will bring peace not only here, but also in other regions,” Trump says, singling out the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as a war in which he hopes progress will be imminently made.\nA pair of bright red Tesla Cybertrucks carrying the markings of Qatar’s Emiri Guard police force had accompanied Trump’s motorcade from the airport to the Emiri Diwan.\nQatar, a key US ally, is expected to announce hundreds of billions of dollars in investments in the US. While the precise details of the investments Qatar plans to announce are unclear, Qatar Airways is expected to disclose a deal to buy around 100 widebody jets from Boeing, a source familiar with the matter says.\nEarlier this week, Trump angrily dismissed concerns over his plans to accept a jet from Qatar to be used as Air Force One.\nSpeaking to journalists after the Gulf summit, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud says that the US and Saudi Arabia “agree to end the war in Gaza and release all hostages.”\nHe says the US administration is willing to make “very courageous decisions” to push toward a ceasefire in Gaza, and “open up pathways to resolving the broader issues of Palestine,” including “moving toward, one hopes, a Palestinian state,” according to a New York Times report.\nThe US did not issue a similar statement in regards to any agreements reached with the Saudis about the war in Gaza.\nAl-Saud also says, “We need to reach a ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible,” adding that “without a ceasefire in Gaza, it would be difficult to supply aid” to the enclave.\nHe also adds that Saudi Arabia “fully supports the US-Iran nuclear talks,” adding that he “hopes for positive results.”\nAdditionally, he says that the Saudis and the Gulf states “will be the first supporters” of a Syrian “economic renaissance.”\n“We want to see Syria build a sustainable economy and build self-sufficiency,” he says. “That all needs a push, and that push will come from its friends in the region and beyond.”\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responds to French President Emmanuel Macron’s criticism of the premier’s Gaza aid policy yesterday, calling Macron’s remarks “blood libels” against the Jewish state, in a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.\n“Macron has once again chosen to side with a murderous Islamist terror organization and echo its false propaganda, while accusing Israel of blood libels,” writes the PMO.\n“Israel is waging a multi-front battle for its existence following the horrific massacre carried out by Hamas against innocent civilians on October 7, including the murder and abduction of dozens of French citizens,” continues the statement. “Instead of standing with the democratic Western camp fighting Islamist terror organizations and calling for the release of the hostages, Macron is once again demanding that Israel surrender and reward terrorism.”\n“Israel will not stop and will not surrender. Prime Minister Netanyahu is determined to achieve all of Israel’s war objectives: the release of all our hostages, the military and governmental defeat of Hamas, and ensuring that Gaza will never again pose a threat to Israel,” concludes the PMO.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday denounced Netanyahu’s policy regarding humanitarian aid to Gaza as “unacceptable” and “shameful,” saying that Europe should consider increasing sanctions.\nUS President Donald Trump praises Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa as a “young, attractive guy,” the New York Times reports.\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump says the new Syrian leader is “young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter.”\n“He’s got a real shot at holding it together,” Trump says. “I spoke with President Erdogan, who is very friendly with him. He feels he’s got a shot of doing a good job. It’s a torn-up country.”\nTrump’s comments came after he met with al-Sharaa, a face-to-face engagement with the onetime insurgent leader who spent years imprisoned by US forces after being captured in Iraq.

Maybe the most credit,” Trump tells reporters aboard Air Force One as he heads from Saudi Arabia to Doha.\n“Look, [Alexander] wouldn’t be there. If it weren’t for us, he wouldn’t be living right now. Probably none of the hostages would be living right now,” he says. “We probably have 20 that are living, that we’ll be getting out step by step.”\nTerror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 58 hostages, including 57 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023.

No one was arrested.\nThe searches were ordered by a judge following a complaint from within the Jewish community, reports say.\nPolice are concerned that Jewish circumcisions are being performed by men who have not received proper medical training. Prosecutors have been investigating illegal circumcisions in the country since last fall.\nRitual circumcision has not yet been outlawed in any European country, but there have been attempts in several countries. Many countries, including Belgium, only allow licensed surgeons to perform the religious ritual, which is often performed in a synagogue.\nLast year, authorities in Ireland arrested a rabbi from London for allegedly performing circumcision without the necessary medical credentials, the first case in years of a rabbi in Europe arrested in connection with a brit milah.\nUnder heavy police presence, several dozen Arab and left-wing Israeli students hold a Nakba memorial ceremony at Tel Aviv University’s Entin Square, as right-wing counter-protesters attempt to disrupt the rally with loud music and taunts from behind a police barricade.\nAs opposed to some previous years, there were no arrests or scuffles between the two sides.\nNakba, or catastrophe, is the Arabic term used for the exodus and expulsion of some 700,000 Palestinians during Israel’s War of Independence in 1948.\nThe annual protest drew special controversy this year after Education Minister Yoav Kisch threatened to revoke funding for Tel Aviv and Hebrew universities over the events.\nPalestinian student activists speak on a raised platform beside a banner that reads in English and Arabic “The Nakba is ongoing.” On one side of the platform is a map of historic Palestine, on which activists mark in red, green and black paint — the colors of the Palestinian flag — communities that were destroyed or heavily damaged in the 1948 war. MK Aida Touma-Suliman marks the communities of Nazareth, where she was born, and Acre.\nActivists, many clad in Palestinian keffiyehs, also carry signs bearing the names of razed Palestinian villages. In lieu of Palestinian flags, which police often confiscate, protesters carry cardboard cut-outs of watermelons, which are identified with the Palestinian cause due to the fruit’s red, black, green and white colors.\nReferring to the ban on Palestinian flags, some signs read, in Arabic, “They’ve forbidden the flag” and “They’re even afraid of watermelons.” Other signs demand: “No to the genocide in Gaza.”\nPalestinian protesters sing patriotic songs, including the poems “Ounadikum wa’Ashad ‘Ayadkum” (I call you and shake your hands) by Mahmoud Darwish and “Mawtini” (my homeland) by Ibrahim Tuqan.\nOne Palestinian student activist describes in Hebrew how her grandfather’s family was expelled to Lebanon from the Galilee village of Al-Bassa, in what is now the Israeli town of Shlomi. In Lebanon, she says, several members of his family, including his sister, were slaughtered in the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre, when Israel turned a blind eye to the atrocities perpetrated in the refugee camp by its anti-Palestinian Christian Lebanese Phalangist allies.\n“The Nakba is ongoing, it’s not just a story of my grandmother and grandfather,” she says. “I’m a refugee in my own land… the fact that I’m afraid to raise my flag is a Nakba.”\n“Just as I thought these are things of the past, they’re back, and we’re watching them in real time,” she says, referring to Gaza. From behind a police barricade, a right-wing Arab-Israeli yells “Liar!”\nAddressing the counter-protesters, the ceremony’s emcee says they will soon find themselves in prison for murder.\n“Then you’ll wish you hadn’t massacred, then you’ll wish you hadn’t murdered,” she says.\nAcross the street, right-wing student group Im Tirzu holds a rally featuring angry speeches against the university for letting the Nakba memorial take place.

The agreement includes a mammoth arms deal worth nearly $142 billion.\nAt the same time, Saudi Arabia and the United States are discussing a deal to cooperate on the kingdom’s ambitions to develop a civil nuclear industry. According to sources, the United States is no longer demanding Saudi Arabia normalize ties with Israel as a condition for progress on civil nuclear cooperation talks.\nEven without the normalization requirement for civil nuclear talks to progress, and despite unpacking the issue from a wider defense treaty, a deal is not yet in close reach, however.\nAgencies contributes to this report.\nUS President Donald Trump tells Gulf leaders that he urgently wants “to make a deal” with Iran to wind down its nuclear program but that Tehran must end its support of proxy groups throughout the region as part of any potential agreement.\nIran “must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars, and permanently and verifiably cease pursuit of nuclear weapons,” Trump says in remarks at a meeting of leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council hosted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Saudi capital.\n“They cannot have a nuclear weapon,” he says.\nThe US and Iran have engaged in four rounds of talks since early last month focused on Iran’s nuclear program. Trump has repeatedly said he believes brokering a deal is possible, but that the window is closing.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu requested that US President Donald Trump not lift US sanctions on Syria, during Netanyahu’s visit to Washington last month, says an Israeli official.\nThe official says the request was made out of concern that a cross-border attack similar to Hamas’s October 7, 2023, assault, could come from Syria.\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the request with the media.\nThe Prime Minister’s Office has not immediately responded to a request for comment on the report.\nTrump on Tuesday said he would ease sanctions on Syria and move to restore ties with its new leader.\nPalestinian media reports new Israeli airstrikes near the European Hospital in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis this morning, where yesterday the IDF targeted Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar.\nThe strikes appear to be an attempt by the IDF to prevent anyone from approaching a tunnel beneath the medical center where Sinwar was targeted. His fate remains unclear.\nOne strike this morning near the hospital hit a bulldozer, according to Palestinian media.\nUS President Donald Trump says that after the appointment of a new president and prime minister of Lebanon earlier this year, “there is a new chance” for the country, “free of Hezbollah’s grip.”\nAfter the Lebanon-based Iran-backed Hezbollah terror group was severely degraded during its conflict against Israel last year, the country appointed President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minster Nawaf Salam.\nSince their appointment, the new government has taken steps to retake control over the country from Hezbollah, which had acted as quasi-sovereign entity over the last several decades.\nAfter the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began unprovoked missile and drone attacks on Israel, with near-daily attacks for over a year. Israel responded with extensive airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, targeting top terror leaders and killing long-time Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah last fall.\nThe IDF also conducted a limited ground invasion of southern Lebanon, which aimed to push the terror group away from Israel’s northern border.\nLast November, Israel reached a ceasefire with Hezbollah, withdrawing troops from most of southern Lebanon and only holding five strategic posts near the border.\nThe deputy prime minister of Oman reportedly says Muscat is confident that the US and Iran can reach an agreement on Tehran’s nuclear program.\nOman’s Deputy Prime Minister for International Affairs Al Sayyid Asaad Tariq Taimur Al Said expresses confidence that a nuclear deal with Iran can be reached, the New York Times reports. Muscat is mediating talks between the US and Iran.\nKing Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain praises the discussions between Iran and US, saying they will “bolster stability and improve prosperity across the region.”\nThe comments are made at the opening of the US-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit in Riyadh, attended by US President Donald Trump.\nForeign Minister Gideon Sa’ar says Israel won’t accept threats from Iran and its regional proxies, and declares Israel will expand the Abraham Accords normalization agreements when the war in Gaza ends, during a press conference in Tokyo this morning.\n“Since October 7th, Israel has been attacked by the evil axis of Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and the Shia militias in Iraq. We were attacked on seven fronts and we didn’t initiate on any of these fronts… we retaliated to the attacks,” says the foreign minister to a group of some 80 reporters, in a transcript of the meeting shared by his office.\n“Israel aspires to expand the Abraham Accords and circle of peace and normalization in the Middle East. And we will do it when this war will be over! But we cannot accept the ongoing threats to our security,” Sa’ar says.\n“Iran must be prevented from obtaining nuclear weapons. The international community must take firm action to make sure of this,” Sa’ar continues, saying, “We thank Japan for its consistent and responsible approach in the International Atomic Energy Agency.”\nAfter being informed that sirens were going off in Israel in response to a Houthi missile attack from Yemen, Sa’ar says, “During this very press conference… millions of Israelis are now running to shelters… I believe this is war crimes. Because it is targeting civilians.”\nSa’ar also thanks US President Donald Trump “for helping secure the release of our soldier and dual Israeli-American citizen Edan Alexander,” who was freed from Hamas captivity on Monday.\nYesterday, Sa’ar told Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya that Israel’s delegation to Doha this week will try “to reach a framework for the release of hostages, as we had sought from the beginning — based on the Witkoff framework.”\n“It is impossible to continue living alongside Hamas’s terror state… They continue to hold our hostages in order to dictate conditions that would allow them to continue their war against Israel,” he said.\nHe also called on Japan to reject any unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, saying, “Unilateral steps against Israel will require an Israeli response. This would corner Israel. I call on Japan to reject such ideas, which would only push peace further away.”\nIran, “like Hamas, they hold a fanatical religious ideology… After what they’ve already done… without nuclear weapons, one can only imagine what they would do if, God forbid, they got them. This must not be allowed,” he told Iwaya.\nIran will hold talks in Istanbul on Friday with European parties to the now-moribund 2015 nuclear deal, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi says, after an earlier meeting planned for May 2 was postponed.\nIran’s foreign minister reiterates the fourth round of Iran-US talks held on May 11 was “difficult” as they focused on the controversial issue of enrichment, adding he hopes the other side will come with “more realistic positions” after gaining a better understanding of Iran’s fundamental positions.\nA fifth round of talks is to be announced by Oman’s foreign ministry, which has acted as mediator since the start of the talks on April 12.\nAraghchi reacts to US President Donald Trump’s comment made yesterday in Riyadh, where Trump called Iran “the most destructive force” in the Middle East and drew a stark contrast with what he called Saudi Arabia’s “constructive vision.”\n“Unfortunately, this is a deceptive view. It is the US that has prevented Iran’s progress through sanctions,” Araghchi says.\nSaudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says that that Arab Gulf states are seeking to work with the US to deescalate tensions in the Middle East.\nThe crown prince makes the comments in opening remarks at the US-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit in Riyadh, attended by US President Donald Trump.\nBin Salman says the kingdom is hoping for an end to the war in Gaza, with a “sustainable solution to the Palestinian issue,” with the New York Times reporting he said he wants it to be reached in line with the Arab Peace Initiative, a 2002 initiative that offered Israel normalized ties with the entire Arab world once it reaches a two-state solution to its conflict with the Palestinians.\nUS President Donald Trump says after his meeting with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Riyadh that the process of normalizing relations with the new Syrian government began with their meeting, adding that he is lifting US sanctions on Syria to “give them a fresh start.”\nAfter the White House said that Trump urged al-Sharaa to join the Abraham Accords and normalize ties with Israel, the US president says that “in the future we will continue to add more countries” to the accords.\nUS President Donald Trump urged Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa to “deport Palestinian terrorists” during their meeting in Saudi Arabia, says a White House spokesperson.\nThe spokesperson adds that Trump also asked al-Sharaa to “to help the United States to prevent the resurgence of ISIS.”\nPolice plan to limit attendance on Mount Meron to 63,000 people at any given moment for the coming Lag B’Omer holiday, says a spokesman for the event to The Times of Israel.\nOver 100,000 mostly Hasidic revelers are expected to ascend to the mountain tomb of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, a 2nd-century mystic and rabbi, over a 16-hour period from Thursday to Friday.\nThough the festivities usually last for 30 hours straight, this year’s celebration will be cut short, as participants will travel home early Friday evening in preparation for Shabbat, the spokesman says.\nAttendees will enter and exit the compound in specific time slots, and are barred from arriving by car. The only way to get to the mountain tomb will be by bus, train or shuttle from a nearby parking lot, with advance registration.\nThe Transportation Ministry also announced major transit shakeups to accommodate the masses of pilgrims expected to throng the Galilee pilgrimage site.\nIsrael Railways plans to divert trains from the center and south for the use of those going to and from the pilgrimage site from Thursday to Friday. The special arrangements cost the ministry some NIS 12.5 million, according to Channel 12.\nIn effect, this means that a major train route between Tel Aviv and Beersheba will not operate from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thursday, and the northern Karmiel station will be closed from Thursday to Friday to all passengers except returnees from Mount Meron.\nAdvocacy group Israel Hofsheet railed against these changes, calling them “discrimination against the general public.”\nThe group notes that Thursday is considered a peak day for railway activity as many soldiers return home for the weekend.\n“The right of Meron attendees to access public transportation cannot come at the expense of IDF soldiers, residents of the north and south, or any other citizen. Regular soldiers have the right to return home for the weekend,” said the organization’s director Uri Keidar in a statement earlier this week.\nUS  President Donald Trump urged Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa to sign onto the Abraham Accords with Israel, a White House spokesperson says.\nThe comments come a day after a surprise US announcement it would lift all sanctions on Damascus’s Islamist-led government.\nThe White House statement comes shortly after Trump met with al-Sharaa in Syria at a meeting in Riyadh also attended by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and, via video link, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nTrump said yesterday that it was his “dream” for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, but acknowledged that Riyadh would do so in its own time.\nAir Canada pushed off resumption of its flight services to Israel until September 8, citing the “ongoing geopolitical uncertainty in the region.”\nCanada’s flag carrier previously planned to restart its route to and from Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport on June 8.\n“Air Canada has a longstanding commitment to the Canada-Israel market and looks forward to restoring service between the two countries,” the airline says.\nWhile Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar held a press conference with about 80 journalists in Japan this morning, a group of pro-Palestinian protesters surrounded the building where the meeting was held, with some trying to break in, according to Sa’ar’s office.\nIn a photo shared by Sa’ar’s spokesperson, one protester is seen holding a sign with the foreign minister’s face on it, labeled “War criminal” in both English and Japanese.\nSecurity personnel are also shown removing a protester who was shouting “genocide” while inside the building, in footage shared by Sa’ar’s office.\nThe disruption comes amid heightened tensions over Israel’s military campaign against the Hamas terror group in Gaza. Israel sent a delegation to Doha this week for final attempts at reaching a hostage-ceasefire deal with the terror group before moving forward with an expanded ground invasion in the enclave.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan joined the meeting between US President Donald Trump and Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa via video call, which was also attended by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, according to the Turkish Anadolu news agency.\nErdogan said during the meeting that Trump’s decision to lift sanctions on Syria was of historic importance, Anadolu reports.\nTrump made the surprise announcement yesterday that the US would lift all sanctions on the Islamist-led government in Syria, which had been a key goal for Turkey.\nصور استقبال الرئيس أحمد الشرع من قبل ولي العهد السعودي ولقاء ترمب مع الرئيس الشرع pic.twitter.com/qTuqgl7dgk\n— Omar Alhariri (@omar_alharir) May 14, 2025\nUS President Donald Trump is meeting with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa ahead of the GCC summit in Riyadh, a day after announcing that the US was lifting sanctions on Syria, a White House official says.\nIt is the first such encounter between the two nations’ leaders in 25 years.\nThe IDF repeats its “urgent” evacuation warning for three Houthi-controlled ports in Yemen, ahead of possible airstrikes.\nOn Sunday, the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesman Col.

An early warning is issued for a wide area.\nThe IDF says it is working to shoot down the projectile.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz comments on yesterday’s strike in Gaza that targeted Mohammad Sinwar, Hamas’s leader in the enclave, vowing to “keep pursuing Hamas and its leaders.”\n“We will not allow the Hamas terrorist organization to use hospitals and humanitarian facilities in Gaza as shelters and terrorist headquarters,” Katz says, referencing the fact that the IDF massive airstrike which targeted Sinwar was on an underground command center below the European Hospital in Khan Younis.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry reported 16 dead and over 70 wounded in the strike, though there was no confirmation that Sinwar was among the casualties. Those numbers cannot be independently verified and do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n“We will pursue Hamas and its leaders and strike it with force everywhere,” adds Katz.\n“We will continue to act with force until all the goals of the war are achieved: the release of all the hostages and the surrender of Hamas,” he says.\nThe military says it destroyed a bomb-making factory uncovered by troops in the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem.\nSoldiers found some 200 bombs and 150 kilograms of explosive materials to make further bombs, which were detonated along with the building, according to the Israel Defense Forces.\npic.twitter.com/UL0FSr9ZCO\n— צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) May 14, 2025\nThe IDF also says that troops arrested 18 suspects across the West Bank yesterday and confiscated a gun and other weaponry. Among those arrested was a Palestinian from Beita suspected of involvement in a recent roadside bomb attack that wounded two reserve soldiers, one of them seriously.\nThe Geological Survey of Israel reports that the survey felt across parts of Israel registered at 2-2.3 in magnitude on the richter scale.\nA leading right-wing political commentator lashes out at freed hostage soldier Edan Alexander and his family, after his parents did not mention Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when thanking US President Donald Trump and the administration’s envoys for their role in securing her son’s release.\nYinon Magal publishes a post on X accusing Edan’s mother Yael Alexander of  a “repulsive performance of ungratefulness and lack of culture” for not thanking Netanyahu, adding “only in the toxic and disturbed atmosphere that the left and media are creating here can this happen.”\nWhile hosting Channel 14’s “The Patriots,” he also attacks Alexander himself, claiming “the circumstances in which he was kidnapped are problematic.”\nMagal’s remarks are denounced by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum as an “ugly attack” on Alexander and his family.\n“Just as Yael Alexander said this evening: We choose unity, love of mankind and commitment to the values we were raised on. Time has run out, the world is watching and history will remember,” the group says in a statement.\nResidents of numerous areas around Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, report feeling an earthquake shortly after a 6.3 magnitude quake struck the island of Crete in Greece.\nThe first big night of Eurovision 2025 in Basel, Switzerland, wraps up smoothly, with 10 acts from the first semifinal advancing to Saturday’s grand final.\nOn Thursday evening, another 16 acts — including Israel’s Yuval Raphael — will take the stage aiming for the last 10 spots in the grand final.\nA handful of Palestinian flags could be seen in the audience tonight after Swiss organizers relaxed regulations from past years around permissible flags, although their presence was not strongly felt.\nAzerbaijan, whose lead singer, Asaf Mishiyev, is a member of the country’s Mountain Jewish community,  did not advance in tonight’s semifinal. Also ending their Eurovision run are Belgium, Cyprus, Croatia and Slovenia. The countries who did advance are Iceland, Poland, Estonia, Sweden, Ukraine, Portugal, Norway, San Marino, Albania and the Netherlands.\nThursday’s winning acts will join tonight’s qualifiers plus the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland on Saturday to vie for the top prize.\nA source in Gaza for the Shin Bet was arrested during the ongoing war and brought to Israel for questioning, during which he admitted to being a double agent, Channel 12 news reports.\nThe source reportedly told Israeli interrogators that on the night of October 6-7, 2023, he received a phone call from his Shin Bet handler and falsely assured them: “There is no offensive deployment by Hamas. I know. I’m up to date.”\nAccording to the Ynet news site, which does not report that he admitted to being a double agent, the Shin Bet asset is a mid-ranking Hamas official.\nHe reportedly had been expected to provide crucial intelligence at a time when many Hamas operatives were already aware of the planned assault.\nThe agent’s statements were interpreted as a sign that an attack was less likely, contributing to the broader Israeli intelligence failure by reinforcing the false belief that Hamas was not preparing for an attack.\nChannel 12 reports that few such calls were made to field agents that night, underscoring what Israeli officials now describe as a significant intelligence blind spot, and the affair is being treated as highly consequential in ongoing internal reviews.",

Kennedy had been reading prepared remarks about his department’s 2026 budget when activists interrupted the session, chanting “RFK kills people with AIDS.” Kennedy jumped from his seat in reaction to the outburst. Cohen then shouted: “Congress pays for bombs to kill children in Gaza,” accusing lawmakers of funding arms by cutting Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income families that Republicans are seeking to slash. Video posted by anti-war group Codepink showed the 74-year-old in handcuffs as Capitol Police escorted him from the chamber. “They need to let food into Gaza, they need to let food to starving kids!” Cohen yelled as he was taken away.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said he would attend the talks if Putin were present. An order issued by Putin on the Kremlin website said the delegation included two officials who took part in the last set of talks held between the two sides in the first weeks following Russia’s 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbor. Those included presidential adviser Vladimir Medinsky and Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin. Also named as part of the delegation was Igor Kostyukov, director of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the GRU, Russia’s Foreign Military Intelligence Agency. Kostyukov was identified in the Kremlin announcement as Chief of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces. Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin was also named as part of the delegation.

        "content": "US President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, has laid out a new plan during hostage negotiations in Doha for a deal to release all or almost all of the hostages in Gaza, end the war, and remove Hamas from power in the Gaza Strip, according to a Channel 12 news report. While mediators have expressed support for the plan, and Hamas has “sent positive signals,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is insisting on a limited deal that does not require Israel to end its military campaign in Gaza, says the report. It notes that Witkoff and Netanyahu spoke by phone earlier today. “The Americans have an attitude of ‘take it or leave it,’ or we’re gone. They are determined that whoever doesn’t go with them will lose a lot,” a senior Israeli official aware of the discussions told Channel 12. In recordings aired this evening by the network, Witkoff is heard telling the hostages’ families yesterday in Tel Aviv that, “Statistically, many more hostages than not have come out through diplomatic means, that’s what’s really worked. The Israeli military has had success, they have, but more often than not, dialogue and diplomacy have really worked here.” Meanwhile, unnamed ministers in the Israeli security cabinet told Channel 12 today that “this cabinet approved [Israel’s planned expanded Gaza ground invasion] in the case that Hamas does not agree to release additional hostages in the [original] Witkoff framework. The prime minister will be judged by us based on how firmly he stands up to the pressure from Trump.” The original Witkoff framework would see a temporary ceasefire of some 40 days, in exchange for about half of the remaining living hostages.",

        "content": "Jordan carried out a medical evacuation of four child cancer patients and 12 of their family members from Gaza to the Hashemite kingdom earlier today, a Jordanian official tells The Times of Israel. This follows King Abdullah’s announcement during a February meeting with US President Donald Trump that Jordan would take in 2,000 child cancer patients from Gaza, as Washington sought to push countries in the region to facilitate the emigration of Palestinians from the war-torn Strip. The total number of cancer patients taken in by Jordan now stands at 33, after 29 were medically evacuated in March along with 44 family members. The slow pace and small number of evacuations have reportedly been a point of tension for US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. and Democratic House Representative Nancy Pelosi, who have both raised their frustration with Jordanian counterparts. Politico reported that Jordanian officials in response noted that Israel was refusing to commit to allowing those who leave to return upon completion of their treatment, leaving family members unable to reunite with their loved ones. The Israeli stance has significantly hampered efforts to find countries to take Gazans, particularly given increasing comments from government officials in Jerusalem about plans to permanently occupy the Strip and build settlements in places where Palestinians once lived. The Jordanian official tells The Times of Israel that Amman is still committed to meeting Abdullah’s pledge to Trump, despite the challenges. “Jordan wanted to evacuate all the children from Gaza by air, but Israeli authorities didn’t agree,” the Jordanian official says, adding that the evacuations took place by land, with patients being driven into Israel and then through the West Bank before reaching Jordan. The transport through Israel ostensibly required the cooperation of Israeli authorities, but a separate Jordanian statement only mentions cooperation with the World Health Organization.",

Rosen, a Democrat, is Jewish and has maintained a vocal pro-Israel stance. Rosen’s office previously confirmed that she and her family were targeted. John Anthony Miller, 44, is sentenced to 46 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. He pleaded guilty in December to one count of threatening a federal official and other charges. Prosecutors say Miller also made threats against the family of another unnamed US senator. In October 2023, Miller made several threatening calls and left a series of threatening voicemails containing antisemitic slurs to Rosen. In some of them, he referenced the Israel-Hamas war and the Holocaust, according to prosecutors. Miller also went to a federal courthouse in Las Vegas, looking for Rosen, but he was turned away after refusing to provide identification, prosecutors said. Outside the courthouse, he shouted threats against Israelis. He was arrested a week later and has been in custody ever since. Jess Marchese, Miller’s lawyer, says Miller struggles with a drug addiction and was high on methamphetamine at the time of the crimes. “I felt the sentence was a little harsh for a nonviolent offender with a minimal criminal record, but we respect the court’s ruling and look forward to John moving forward and dealing with his addiction,” Marchese says in a text to The Associated Press. AP also emails Rosen’s office. At the time of Miller’s arrest, a spokesperson for Rosen’s office said in a statement that threats against public officials should be taken seriously.",

Asked whether Germany would implement an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Merz says that in principle it should be possible for an Israeli premier to visit Germany. How this could happen would be clarified when necessary, he says at the joint press conference with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in Berlin, adding that no bilateral visits by him or Netanyahu are currently planned. Merz says future financial support for UNRWA, the United Nations’ agency for Palestinian refugees, is conditional on the organization being reformed. Guterres, who is meeting Merz in Berlin, calls for a Gaza ceasefire and “unimpeded humanitarian access” to the Palestinian territory. “In relation to Gaza, I reiterate my call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, unimpeded humanitarian access and an immediate cessation of hostilities allowing for an irreversible path towards a two-state solution,” Guterres says.",

Brogan Stewart and Marco Pitzettu, both 25, and Christopher Ringrose, 34, were preparing an act of terrorism when they were arrested in February 2024, prosecutors said at the start of their trial in March. The trio were also each charged with two counts of collecting information which may be useful to someone preparing an act of terrorism, while Ringrose was charged with manufacturing a component for a 3D-printed FGC9 firearm. They pleaded not guilty but jurors at Sheffield Crown Court today convict them of all charges. They will be sentenced on July 17. “Stewart, Pitzettu, and Ringrose have today been rightfully convicted of multiple terrorism offenses,” Detective Chief Superintendent James Dunkerley, Head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, says in a statement. “They were a group that espoused vile racist views and advocated for violence, all to support their extreme right-wing mindset. “Some of their defense in court was that it was all fantasy or just part of harmless chat, however all three took real-world steps to plan and prepare for carrying out an attack on innocent citizens.” Prosecutor Jonathan Sandiford had told jurors that the three defendants expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler and perpetrators of notorious terrorist attacks, as well as hatred for non-white people, especially Muslims and immigrants. “It was their belief that there must soon come a time when there would be a race war between the white and other races,” Sandiford says.",

His funeral will be held this evening at 6 p.m. at the Ashkelon Cemetery. He leaves behind a wife and three daughters. Upon hearing about the October 7 Hamas attack, Pibenev left the police station in Hebron and drove to his home in Yated, a moshav near the Gaza border. On the way there, he killed at least 13 Hamas terrorists. Pibenev encountered the first two gunmen near Urim Junction. He stopped his car after hearing the sound of bullets, then identified and shot the pair dead. Minutes later, two others began to shoot at him, embroiling him in a quick gunfight. “After I saw them fall and not move, I returned to my car and continued to travel,” he said in an interview to the police spokesperson’s office. He went on to kill nine others, several who were heading toward Nir Yitzhak. After reuniting with his family in Yated, he went out again to join up with the moshav’s volunteer security team. “We had trained for scenarios like this, but I never imagined we’d face such a large number of terrorists,” he said. Pibenev’s death was announced on social media. Three months ago, his wife, Hani Liderman-Pibenev, posted about the “silent victims of October 7,” referring to those struggling with survivor’s guilt and PTSD following the massacre. “If there are people around you who have been deteriorating since that Shabbat, turn the world upside down to make sure they get professional help and proper treatment. Don’t try to save them by yourselves,” she wrote.",

We saw the destroyed art gallery… We promised to help to rebuild this place.” “Yet we are further away from the future than we would wish,” he continues, saying, “The kibbutz is not yet inhabited, the wounds are deep… 585 days after the massacre, there are still hostages in the hands of Hamas, including German companions… Germany will not forget them, and I will not forget them. Our voice will not remain silent, as long as they have not returned.” The presidents also met with leaders and residents of the kibbutz, some of whom are survivors of the October 7 attack, Herzog’s office adds. Plans for reconstructing the gallery were presented at a special ceremony, before the presidents planted a tree “as a symbol of renewal and hope for the Be’eri community,” the statement says.

Macron, speaking yesterday in an interview with TF1 television, accused Netanyahu of blocking aid into the Strip and warned that Europe may reconsider its cooperation agreements with Israel. “My job is to do everything I can to make it stop,” Macron said. Katz responds that “it is expected that someone who considers himself a friend of Israel would stand by Israel in its war against the murderous terrorist organization Hamas and the Iranian axis of evil.” “The IDF operates with the highest level of morality under extremely difficult and complex circumstances — certainly more than anything France has done in its past wars,” he adds.",

A pair of bright red Tesla Cybertrucks carrying the markings of Qatar’s Emiri Guard police force had accompanied Trump’s motorcade from the airport to the Emiri Diwan. Qatar, a key US ally, is expected to announce hundreds of billions of dollars in investments in the US. While the precise details of the investments Qatar plans to announce are unclear, Qatar Airways is expected to disclose a deal to buy around 100 widebody jets from Boeing, a source familiar with the matter says. Earlier this week, Trump angrily dismissed concerns over his plans to accept a jet from Qatar to be used as Air Force One.",

The US did not issue a similar statement in regards to any agreements reached with the Saudis about the war in Gaza. Al-Saud also says, “We need to reach a ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible,” adding that “without a ceasefire in Gaza, it would be difficult to supply aid” to the enclave. He also adds that Saudi Arabia “fully supports the US-Iran nuclear talks,” adding that he “hopes for positive results.” Additionally, he says that the Saudis and the Gulf states “will be the first supporters” of a Syrian “economic renaissance.” “We want to see Syria build a sustainable economy and build self-sufficiency,” he says. “That all needs a push, and that push will come from its friends in the region and beyond.”",

Prime Minister Netanyahu is determined to achieve all of Israel’s war objectives: the release of all our hostages, the military and governmental defeat of Hamas, and ensuring that Gaza will never again pose a threat to Israel,” concludes the PMO. French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday denounced Netanyahu’s policy regarding humanitarian aid to Gaza as “unacceptable” and “shameful,” saying that Europe should consider increasing sanctions.",

They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF. Israel says it has grave concerns about three hostages. Alexander was released from captivity in the Gaza Strip on Monday in what has been described as a goodwill gesture from the Palestinian terror group Hamas to Trump ahead of the US president’s visit to the region.

No one was arrested. The searches were ordered by a judge following a complaint from within the Jewish community, reports say. Police are concerned that Jewish circumcisions are being performed by men who have not received proper medical training. Prosecutors have been investigating illegal circumcisions in the country since last fall. Ritual circumcision has not yet been outlawed in any European country, but there have been attempts in several countries. Many countries, including Belgium, only allow licensed surgeons to perform the religious ritual, which is often performed in a synagogue. Last year, authorities in Ireland arrested a rabbi from London for allegedly performing circumcision without the necessary medical credentials, the first case in years of a rabbi in Europe arrested in connection with a brit milah.",

        "caption": "Protesters sing a patriotic Palestinian song during a Nakba memorial ceremony outside Tel Aviv University, May 15, 2025. (Noam Lehmann/The Times of Israel)\n",
        "content": "Under heavy police presence, several dozen Arab and left-wing Israeli students hold a Nakba memorial ceremony at Tel Aviv University’s Entin Square, as right-wing counter-protesters attempt to disrupt the rally with loud music and taunts from behind a police barricade. As opposed to some previous years, there were no arrests or scuffles between the two sides. Nakba, or catastrophe, is the Arabic term used for the exodus and expulsion of some 700,000 Palestinians during Israel’s War of Independence in 1948. The annual protest drew special controversy this year after Education Minister Yoav Kisch threatened to revoke funding for Tel Aviv and Hebrew universities over the events. Palestinian student activists speak on a raised platform beside a banner that reads in English and Arabic “The Nakba is ongoing.” On one side of the platform is a map of historic Palestine, on which activists mark in red, green and black paint — the colors of the Palestinian flag — communities that were destroyed or heavily damaged in the 1948 war. MK Aida Touma-Suliman marks the communities of Nazareth, where she was born, and Acre. Activists, many clad in Palestinian keffiyehs, also carry signs bearing the names of razed Palestinian villages. In lieu of Palestinian flags, which police often confiscate, protesters carry cardboard cut-outs of watermelons, which are identified with the Palestinian cause due to the fruit’s red, black, green and white colors. Referring to the ban on Palestinian flags, some signs read, in Arabic, “They’ve forbidden the flag” and “They’re even afraid of watermelons.” Other signs demand: “No to the genocide in Gaza.” Palestinian protesters sing patriotic songs, including the poems “Ounadikum wa’Ashad ‘Ayadkum” (I call you and shake your hands) by Mahmoud Darwish and “Mawtini” (my homeland) by Ibrahim Tuqan. One Palestinian student activist describes in Hebrew how her grandfather’s family was expelled to Lebanon from the Galilee village of Al-Bassa, in what is now the Israeli town of Shlomi. In Lebanon, she says, several members of his family, including his sister, were slaughtered in the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre, when Israel turned a blind eye to the atrocities perpetrated in the refugee camp by its anti-Palestinian Christian Lebanese Phalangist allies. “The Nakba is ongoing, it’s not just a story of my grandmother and grandfather,” she says. “I’m a refugee in my own land… the fact that I’m afraid to raise my flag is a Nakba.” “Just as I thought these are things of the past, they’re back, and we’re watching them in real time,” she says, referring to Gaza. From behind a police barricade, a right-wing Arab-Israeli yells “Liar!” Addressing the counter-protesters, the ceremony’s emcee says they will soon find themselves in prison for murder. “Then you’ll wish you hadn’t massacred, then you’ll wish you hadn’t murdered,” she says. Across the street, right-wing student group Im Tirzu holds a rally featuring angry speeches against the university for letting the Nakba memorial take place. A large banner reads “Nakba Harta,” or “the Nakba is a load of crap.” Deputy Minister Almog Cohen, of the far-right Otzma Yehudit party, approaches the memorial with a megaphone, attempting to drown out proceedings with a solo rendition of “Hatikva,” Israel’s national anthem. A spokesperson for Tel Aviv University — which itself stands on the ruins of the Palestinian village of Sheikh Munis — says the school “is the largest and most diverse university in Israel — liberal and pluralistic — and it takes pride in that.” “In these difficult times… the university calls on all students across the spectrum to demonstrate tolerance and refrain from any calls that incite violence.” The spokesperson notes that the Nakba commemoration is an annual event that takes place outside the university gates, “and is therefore under the responsibility and with the approval of the police.”",

        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appoints Foreign Ministry Director General Eden Bar Tal as temporary Civil Service commissioner for one month starting today, after the High Court of Justice ruled on Monday that the government’s method for appointing a new head of the Civil Service was invalid. And in a statement to the press, the Prime Minister’s Office lambastes the High Court decision to intervene over how the Civil Service commissioner is appointed, accusing the court of “acting like the legislature” and “interpreting the law in total opposition” to its wording and the intention of the Knesset. The Law for the Civil Service states that it is not obligatory to issue a public tender for the role of Civil Service commissioner, but the High Court ruled two to one that the appointments process must be competitive. The government passed a cabinet resolution in 2024 allowing the prime minister to choose a single candidate for the post, to be vetted by committee. The PMO says that as a result of the decision, the government will back legislation submitted to the Knesset yesterday to stipulate that the position need not be filled through a competitive process.",

The agreement includes a mammoth arms deal worth nearly $142 billion. At the same time, Saudi Arabia and the United States are discussing a deal to cooperate on the kingdom’s ambitions to develop a civil nuclear industry. According to sources, the United States is no longer demanding Saudi Arabia normalize ties with Israel as a condition for progress on civil nuclear cooperation talks. Even without the normalization requirement for civil nuclear talks to progress, and despite unpacking the issue from a wider defense treaty, a deal is not yet in close reach, however.

After the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began unprovoked missile and drone attacks on Israel, with near-daily attacks for over a year. Israel responded with extensive airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, targeting top terror leaders and killing long-time Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah last fall. The IDF also conducted a limited ground invasion of southern Lebanon, which aimed to push the terror group away from Israel’s northern border.

And we will do it when this war will be over! But we cannot accept the ongoing threats to our security,” Sa’ar says. “Iran must be prevented from obtaining nuclear weapons. The international community must take firm action to make sure of this,” Sa’ar continues, saying, “We thank Japan for its consistent and responsible approach in the International Atomic Energy Agency.” After being informed that sirens were going off in Israel in response to a Houthi missile attack from Yemen, Sa’ar says, “During this very press conference… millions of Israelis are now running to shelters… I believe this is war crimes. Because it is targeting civilians.” Sa’ar also thanks US President Donald Trump “for helping secure the release of our soldier and dual Israeli-American citizen Edan Alexander,” who was freed from Hamas captivity on Monday. Yesterday, Sa’ar told Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya that Israel’s delegation to Doha this week will try “to reach a framework for the release of hostages, as we had sought from the beginning — based on the Witkoff framework.” “It is impossible to continue living alongside Hamas’s terror state… They continue to hold our hostages in order to dictate conditions that would allow them to continue their war against Israel,” he said. He also called on Japan to reject any unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, saying, “Unilateral steps against Israel will require an Israeli response. This would corner Israel. I call on Japan to reject such ideas, which would only push peace further away.” Iran, “like Hamas, they hold a fanatical religious ideology… After what they’ve already done… without nuclear weapons, one can only imagine what they would do if, God forbid, they got them. This must not be allowed,” he told Iwaya.",

        "content": "Iran will hold talks in Istanbul on Friday with European parties to the now-moribund 2015 nuclear deal, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi says, after an earlier meeting planned for May 2 was postponed. Iran’s foreign minister reiterates the fourth round of Iran-US talks held on May 11 was “difficult” as they focused on the controversial issue of enrichment, adding he hopes the other side will come with “more realistic positions” after gaining a better understanding of Iran’s fundamental positions. A fifth round of talks is to be announced by Oman’s foreign ministry, which has acted as mediator since the start of the talks on April 12. Araghchi reacts to US President Donald Trump’s comment made yesterday in Riyadh, where Trump called Iran “the most destructive force” in the Middle East and drew a stark contrast with what he called Saudi Arabia’s “constructive vision.” “Unfortunately, this is a deceptive view. It is the US that has prevented Iran’s progress through sanctions,” Araghchi says.",

        "content": "Police plan to limit attendance on Mount Meron to 63,000 people at any given moment for the coming Lag B’Omer holiday, says a spokesman for the event to The Times of Israel. Over 100,000 mostly Hasidic revelers are expected to ascend to the mountain tomb of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, a 2nd-century mystic and rabbi, over a 16-hour period from Thursday to Friday. Though the festivities usually last for 30 hours straight, this year’s celebration will be cut short, as participants will travel home early Friday evening in preparation for Shabbat, the spokesman says. Attendees will enter and exit the compound in specific time slots, and are barred from arriving by car. The only way to get to the mountain tomb will be by bus, train or shuttle from a nearby parking lot, with advance registration. The Transportation Ministry also announced major transit shakeups to accommodate the masses of pilgrims expected to throng the Galilee pilgrimage site. Israel Railways plans to divert trains from the center and south for the use of those going to and from the pilgrimage site from Thursday to Friday. The special arrangements cost the ministry some NIS 12.5 million, according to Channel 12. In effect, this means that a major train route between Tel Aviv and Beersheba will not operate from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thursday, and the northern Karmiel station will be closed from Thursday to Friday to all passengers except returnees from Mount Meron. Advocacy group Israel Hofsheet railed against these changes, calling them “discrimination against the general public.” The group notes that Thursday is considered a peak day for railway activity as many soldiers return home for the weekend. “The right of Meron attendees to access public transportation cannot come at the expense of IDF soldiers, residents of the north and south, or any other citizen. Regular soldiers have the right to return home for the weekend,” said the organization’s director Uri Keidar in a statement earlier this week.",

According to the report, the information gleaned by the secret intelligence-sharing coalition, codenamed Kilowatt, “was offered [to Israel] without any oversight by parliaments or elected politicians” from any of the involved nations, for fear of breaking laws or causing public or political scandal. The report says the intelligence sharing began a year before the 1972 attack on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics, and involved intelligence services from 18 countries. The mechanism “circulated raw intelligence with details of safe houses and vehicles, the movements of key individuals seen as dangerous, news on tactics used by Palestinian armed groups, and analysis,” the report says. The report adds that after the 1972 Munich attack, which killed 11 Israeli athletes, the intelligence-sharing mechanism was used to provide Israel with targets for its assassination campaign against the Palestinian terror operatives who ordered and carried out the attack, especially those who resided in European cities in the 1970s. According to the report, the secret intelligence-sharing system was discovered by Dr. Aviva Guttmann, a historian at Aberystwyth University. while studying encrypted cables found in Swiss archives.",

The source reportedly told Israeli interrogators that on the night of October 6-7, 2023, he received a phone call from his Shin Bet handler and falsely assured them: “There is no offensive deployment by Hamas. I know. I’m up to date.” According to the Ynet news site, which does not report that he admitted to being a double agent, the Shin Bet asset is a mid-ranking Hamas official. He reportedly had been expected to provide crucial intelligence at a time when many Hamas operatives were already aware of the planned assault. The agent’s statements were interpreted as a sign that an attack was less likely, contributing to the broader Israeli intelligence failure by reinforcing the false belief that Hamas was not preparing for an attack.

    "date": "Updated 03:32 AM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday denounced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s policy regarding humanitarian aid to Gaza as “unacceptable” and “shameful,” saying that Europeans should consider increasing sanctions.\n“What the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is doing is unacceptable… There is no water, no medicine, the wounded cannot get out, the doctors cannot get in. What he is doing is shameful,” Macron told TF1 television.\n“We need the United States. President (Donald) Trump has the levers. I have had tough words with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I got angry, but they (Israel) don’t depend on us, they depend on American weapons,” he said.\nMacron emphasized that he himself had visited the border between Egypt and Gaza earlier this year where he saw that “all the aid that France and other countries deliver” is “blocked by the Israelis.”\n“This is an unacceptable humanitarian tragedy,” he said, adding that “it is not up to a president of the republic to say ‘this is a genocide’ but rather to historians.”\n“My job is to do everything I can to make it stop,” Macron also said, while raising the possibility of revisiting the European Union’s cooperation agreements with Israel.\nThese pacts include terms that include the absence of customs duties on certain products.\nIsrael has sealed off the Gaza Strip since early March, when it resumed its military campaign against Hamas following the collapse of a hostage release and ceasefire deal, during which thousands of aid trucks entered the enclave.\nIsrael has said that the Hamas terror group stole much of the aid entering the territory, using it to supply its members and maintain control over the population, and therefore Israel won’t allow aid in until it puts in place a system giving it control over the distribution. Jerusalem also justifies the aid blockade as a necessary tool to pressure Hamas to release the 58 hostages held in the Strip.\n“The humanitarian crisis (in Gaza) is the most serious we have known” since October 7, 2023, said Macron, referring to the date of the Hamas-led onslaught that started the ongoing war in Gaza.\nThe French president’s remarks Tuesday came amid worsening ties between Jerusalem and Paris over the war in Gaza, with Macron pressing Netanyahu on renewing humanitarian aid during a phone call last month. That conversation came days after Netanyahu’s son lobbed an obscenity at Macron for saying France could recognize a Palestinian state.\nIsrael has accused Macron of blocking Israeli arms manufacturers from taking part in industry shows in France. Macron has also angered Jerusalem by calling for an arms embargo on Israel as the only way to end the fighting in Gaza.",

    "subheading": "US president acknowledges hosts not rushing to normalize ties with current Israeli government as Gaza conflict rages, says he’s working to end the war ‘as quickly as possible,’ return all hostages; only mentions Israel once",
    "date": "Updated 11:53 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that it is his “dream” for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, before acknowledging that Riyadh will do so in its own time.\n“It’s my fervent hope, wish and even my dream that Saudi Arabia… will soon be joining the Abraham Accords,” Trump said in a foreign policy speech at an investment summit in Riyadh on the first day of his Middle East visit.\n“But you’ll do it in your own time,” Trump subsequently added, seeming to acknowledge that Riyadh is not currently prepared to normalize relations, given the ongoing war in Gaza and the current Israeli government’s refusal to establish a pathway to a future Palestinian state.\nSuccessive American administrations have sought to broker such an agreement, framing it as the “crown jewel” of potential normalization deals, in light of Saudi Arabia’s overarching status in the Arab and Muslim worlds.\nFormer president Joe Biden’s administration sought to include a normalization accord in a “mega-deal” it worked to sign with Riyadh. It envisioned a series of bilateral agreements, including the first US defense treaty in decades that would have provided Saudi Arabia guarantees that Washington would come to its defense if the latter were attacked under certain circumstances.\nSuch a treaty would have required ratification from two-thirds of the Senate, and the Biden administration hoped that folding in an Israel-Saudi normalization deal would help gain support for the package from both sides of the aisle.\nRiyadh has long made clear, however, that such an agreement would require a political horizon for the Palestinians — something that many progressive Democrats would also have demanded in exchange for their support of the “mega deal.”\nThe Biden administration had managed to make significant progress in the series of bilateral agreements with Saudi Arabia — and was slated to begin serious discussions with Riyadh regarding the exact terms of the Palestinian component of the package — when Hamas launched its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.\nThe onslaught and ensuing war derailed the normalization effort and Riyadh began to recognize that it would need more concrete steps toward the establishment of a Palestinian state, as solidarity with the Palestinians in Saudi Arabia and the region at large skyrocketed due to the devastating war in Gaza.\nAs the war continued through the end of Biden’s term, Saudi officials began speaking of trying to negotiate smaller bilateral deals with the US that wouldn’t require a normalization deal with Israel. Those weren’t finalized by the time Biden left office, but Trump’s administration has sought to move them forward, reportedly considering a deal that would allow for the establishment of a Saudi civilian nuclear program.\nTrump has also pledged to broker an Israel-Saudi normalization deal, repeatedly asserting that additional countries would quickly join the Abraham Accords. But his remarks Tuesday indicated his recognition that Riyadh won’t be joining as quickly as he may have hoped.\nAt the same time, Trump touted his efforts to “get that [Gaza] war ended as quickly as possible,” in what would remove one of the two key obstacles to Riyadh joining the Abraham Accords.\nTrump also highlighted Monday’s release of American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, whom Hamas freed after 584 days in captivity in a gesture of goodwill to the US, in the hopes that Washington will, in turn, coax Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the war in Gaza.\n“We’ve been working tirelessly to bring back all hostages held by Hamas,” Trump said. Israel agreed to send a negotiating team to Doha on Tuesday at the US’s request, but Netanyahu has reiterated to coalition partners that he only intends to agree to a temporary ceasefire. Hamas has offered to release all remaining 58 hostages at once in exchange for a permanent ceasefire, but Netanyahu has rejected the trade, arguing that it would leave the terror group in power.\nTrump also used his speech to stress that “all civilized people must condemn the October 7 atrocities against Israel.”\n“The people of Gaza deserve a much better future, but that will or cannot occur as long as their leaders choose to kidnap, torture and target innocent men, women and children for political ends,” he said.\nThere were several other parts of the speech that indicated daylight between the US and Israel, including on Syria, Iran and broader foreign policy. Trump only mentioned Israel by name one time — as quoted above in reference to Hamas’s October 7, 2023 invasion and massacre — in the over 30-minute address that largely focused on the Middle East.\nMeanwhile, he lavished praise on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, calling him the US’s strongest partner. “One of our great, great partners, no matter who we look to, and we have great partners in the world, but we have none stronger and nobody like the gentleman that’s right before me,” Trump said of Bin Salman, looking at the crown prince. “He’s your greatest representative, greatest representative. And if I didn’t like him, I’d get out of here so fast. You know that don’t you? He knows me well. I do, I like him a lot. I like him too much… Great guy.”\nIn what was arguably his biggest announcement in the address, Trump declared the lifting of all of Washington’s sanctions on Syria.\n“I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” he said, adding that he had made the decision after being pressed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nBin Salman rose to his feet in the front row to applaud the announcement and the rest of the crowd in the Riyadh auditorium followed.\n“The sanctions were brutal and crippling and served a really important function at the time, but now it’s [the new Syrian government’s] time to shine,” Trump said. “So I say, ‘Good luck, Syria.’”\nThe new US policy would appear to put him at odds with Israel, which has urged a more cautious approach to the new Syrian government led by Ahmed al-Sharaa. Jerusalem has been quietly lobbying the administration and congressional lawmakers to buck the fledgling Islamist government of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in favor of establishing a decentralized series of autonomous ethnic regions, with the southern one bordering Israel being demilitarized.\nTurning to Iran, Trump reiterated his desire to strike a deal with the Islamic Republic through the ongoing nuclear talks. He still threatened to cripple Iran’s economy, but stopped short of raising a potential military strike, as he has done in the past.\n“I want to make a deal with Iran… to make your region and the world a safer place,” Trump said. “But if Iran’s leadership rejects this olive branch and continues to attack their neighbors, then we will have no choice but to inflict massive maximum pressure [and] drive Iranian oil exports to zero like I did before.”\n“Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. But with that said, Iran can have a much brighter future,” he added. “This is an offer that will not last forever. The time is right now for them to choose… Things are happening at a very fast pace.”\nTrump then took swings at “neocons” and “interventionists” who oppose his foreign policy.\n“It’s crucial for the wider world to know this great transformation [in the Middle East] has not come from Western interventionists, or flying people in beautiful planes giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs,” Trump said.\n“In the end, the so-called nation builders wrecked far more nations than they built and the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,” he continued.\n“The gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called ‘nation builders,’ neocons, or liberal non-profits.\n“Instead, the birth of a modern Middle East has been brought by the people of the region themselves — the people that are right here, the people [who] have lived here all their lives, developing your own sovereign countries, pursuing your own unique visions and charting your own destinies in your own way.”\n“You achieved a modern miracle the Arabian way,” Trump added.\nThe comments reflected the mounting battle between the more pro-Trump isolationist wing of the Republican Party and hawkish conservatives who are more fervent supporters of Israel, with the president making clear in his remarks that he sides with the former camp.\nThe latter group has been critical of US special envoy Steve Witkoff’s efforts to broker a nuclear deal with Iran and US special envoy Adam Boehler’s efforts to negotiate directly with Hamas earlier this year. Trump’s inner circle has ardently defended Witkoff, while Trump himself has kept Boehler on as hostage envoy, despite efforts by hawkish Republicans and senior Israeli officials to sideline him.",

    "date": "Updated 11:29 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "While visiting former American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander at Tel Aviv’s Ichilov Hospital Tuesday morning, US special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff gifted the 21-year-old a Star of David chain that had belonged to Witkoff’s late son Andrew.\nWitkoff had himself worn the necklace since his 22-year-old son died in 2011, and gave it to Alexander in a gesture that “moved Edan’s family to tears,” a day after the envoy helped secure his release from Hamas captivity, Channel 12 news reported.\n“You would be doing a great honor to my son if you keep wearing this,” Witkoff told Alexander, as he placed the necklace around the dual national’s neck, according to the report.\nDuring the meeting, Witkoff and Alexander also held a 10-minute phone call with US President Donald Trump, who told the freed hostage that the American public “can’t wait” to see him back in the country, the report said.\n“Your mother kept pushing me the whole time — but that’s okay. I can’t wait to see you at the White House. The whole nation wants to see you. You’re a bigger celebrity than I am right now. Enjoy it while you can, stay strong. Take it easy,” Trump said to Alexander, according to the network, which reported in Hebrew on the English-language conversation.\n“Steve [Witkoff ] did a great job. Honestly, it was me, but I’ll give Steve the credit,” Trump reportedly told Alexander.\nAsked by the US president how Hamas had treated him, Alexander reportedly answered: “Since you got elected, my conditions improved dramatically. There are tons of cameras and people around me right now — I can’t share much at the moment. We’ll talk in private.”\nAlexander’s release, after 584 days in Hamas captivity, was widely seen as a goodwill gesture by the terror group to Trump, who is due in Doha on Wednesday as part of a state visit to Gulf countries. The soldier was the last known living US citizen in Hamas captivity.\nThe release jump-started negotiations on a Gaza ceasefire-hostage release deal in Doha, where Israeli negotiators were set to arrive on Tuesday. Witkoff and US hostage envoy Adam Boehler are also set to join the talks.\nAfter visiting Alexander on Tuesday, Witkoff told hostages’ families that he and Boehler would not be going to Doha if they were not convinced there was a chance for progress in the talks, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.\n“Your children are not my children, but now I’ve made them my children,” said Witkoff in a video the Forum published from the meeting. “Like I’m doing something. Feels like a completely unselfish act to help somebody else.”\nAlexander, the son of Israeli parents, was raised in Tenafly, New Jersey, and came to Israel to serve in the IDF’s Golani infantry Brigade. He was kidnapped from the Kissufim military base on October 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages, sparking the war in Gaza.\nIn a statement to the press from Ichilov Hospital Tuesday evening, his mother Yael said her son suffered from lack of water, food and aid, and feared death during IDF strikes. She thanked Trump, Witkoff and Boehler, saying they had “worked day and night to bring back my son.”\nAlexander’s father, Adi, said, “We’ll never be able to express what that means to us, but we’ll never forget the tireless effort on Edan’s behalf; we are in their debt.” He added that Edan would soon return to his family and friends in Tenafly.\nEdan himself, on Tuesday, published his first social media post since returning to Israel. “Home sweet home,” he wrote, alongside a selfie showing him in sunglasses and holding a beer bottle.\nAfter his meeting with Alexander, Witkoff told the families of hostages held in Gaza that Hamas is “afraid of Donald Trump” and “should be.”\nIn brief footage from the lengthy meeting he and US hostage envoy Adam Boehler held with the families in Tel Aviv, aired by the Kan public broadcaster, Witkoff related that Alexander is “doing better than I would have thought. They actually treated him better. So for those who have relatives who are alive, I think that’s an important data point.”\nHe elaborated: “Edan told me that when the president was elected, he began to get treated well. And that’s a really interesting data point — that people evidently are being treated better there, because Hamas is afraid of Donald Trump. And the truth is, they should be.”\nIn a separate audio clip broadcast on Channel 12, Witkoff could be heard telling the families that if a diplomatic deal cannot be reached to solve the hostage crisis, it will be one of the worst failures of his life.\n“The last thing I wanted to do was to call the Alexander family and give them notice of this thing,” Witkoff says, referring to Edan’s release, “because we thought six weeks ago we were getting him out, by the way, and he was going to be part of a larger release. And we were close. And, like that, it didn’t happen.”\nNow, said Witkoff, “everything is moving in the direction of: create a deal to diplomatically solve it. And if we can’t diplomatically solve it, it’s going to be, in my view — I’m not going to speak for Adam, okay — but to me, it will be one of the worst failures that I can ever endure in my life.”\nתיעוד בלעדי מתוך דברי ויטקוף למשפחות החטופים: \"חמאס התייחס לעידן טוב יותר מאז בחירת טראמפ\" | @SuleimanMas1 עם המסר המעודד#מהדורתכאןחדשות pic.twitter.com/X7RUOFyHdH\n— כאן חדשות (@kann_news) May 13, 2025\nChannel 12 also reported that Alexander, on his release yesterday, immediately told Israeli officials and Witkoff that Matan Zangauker must be urgently returned. He was held with Zangauker for the past eight months, the report said.\nZangauker’s mother, Einav, has said they were held together in the same tunnel, with no other hostages.\nEdan’s report on Matan was conveyed to Einav, the report said, leaving her in tears and more worried than ever for her son, who has medical issues.\nJessica Steinberg contributed to this report.",

    "date": "Updated 10:38 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "President Isaac Herzog plans to attend Pope Leo XIV’s inauguration, set to take place in Rome on May 18, his spokesperson confirmed to The Times of Israel on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, both the American Jewish Committee and the Jewish Community of Rome announced that right after his appointment, the new pontiff reached out to their rabbinical leadership to reaffirm his commitment to interfaith dialogue.\nAt Pope Francis’s funeral last month, Israel was represented only by its Ambassador to the Holy See, Yaron Sideman, in a move that was seen by many as a nadir in ties between the Vatican and Jerusalem in recent years.\nFrancis’s relationship with Israel and many Jewish leaders deteriorated after October 7, 2023, as they accused him of failing to pin blame sufficiently on Hamas and of seeming to equate the terror group’s assault on Israeli towns with the Jewish state’s military response.\nAddressing a group of reporters at the Latin Patriarchate in the Old City of Jerusalem on Tuesday, the patriarch, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, said that he hoped Herzog’s intention to participate in the inauguration could mark a turning point that would leave the tensions behind.\n“The president of the State of Israel will be there,” he said. “I read it as a desire to change the situation.”\nPizzaballa also said he expected the new pope to visit Israel and the Middle East, although it was not yet possible to determine when that would happen.\n“For sure, a papal visit to the Middle East, the Holy Land, but also other [places], needs to be done, but I do not know the timing,” he said. “Jerusalem is the center of the life of the church.”\nAsked whether Leo had already phoned the Catholic parish in Gaza, as Francis used to do almost every night, the cardinal said, “It is too early, let him breathe for a few weeks.”\nHe also denounced the humanitarian situation in the Strip, expressing concern about the aid blockade imposed by Israel since March 2.\n“It is an inconceivable situation, ethically unacceptable; it is not the way to resolve the conflict; it will create more hatred,” Pizzaballa said. “We call all those who have the power to make decisions to end this, to solve the conflict in a different way.”\nIsrael says the blockade aims to pressure Hamas to release the 58 hostages it still holds. It says it won’t let aid back in until a new system giving it control over distribution is put in place, accusing Hamas of siphoning off supplies.\nAhead of the conclave, Pizzaballa was considered a possible successor to Francis. The cardinal, however, dismissed the notion, saying that he always knew it would not happen.\n“I felt very serene as I knew I would come back to Jerusalem, though I found the rumors surrounding me slightly irritating,” he said.\nDuring the press conference, Pizzaballa also emphasized the importance of Jewish-Christian dialogue and suggested that Leo’s messages to different rabbis reaffirmed it.\nLeo, the first US-born pope, sent a letter to Rabbi Noam Marans, the director of Interreligious Affairs of the American Jewish Committee, who posted the letter on the social platform X late on Monday.\n“Trusting in the assistance of the almighty, I pledge to continue and strengthen the Church’s dialogue and cooperation with the Jewish people in the spirit of the Second Vatican Council’s declaration Nostra Aetate,” Leo said in the letter.\nA similar message was sent to the Chief Rabbi of Rome Riccardo Di Segni, the Jewish Community said in a statement, adding that the rabbi welcomed the message “with gratitude and satisfaction.”\nNostra Aetate was a landmark document in the 1962-1965 Council that repudiated the concept of collective Jewish guilt for the death of Jesus and urged dialogue with non-Christian religions.\nThe brief document revolutionized Catholic relations with Jews after centuries of persecution and mistrust. The dialogue that ensued over the following two decades made it possible for Pope John Paul II to become the first pontiff to visit a synagogue, giving a speech in Rome’s main temple in 1986, where he called Jews “our beloved elder brothers.”\nAfter years of often-tense relations, the Vatican and Israel signed a “fundamental agreement” in 1993 and exchanged full ambassadors the following year.\nA Vatican source said Rabbi Marans would attend Leo’s inaugural Mass on Sunday. More than a dozen other Jewish leaders from around the world were also expected to attend, the source said.\nThe Jewish Community of Rome confirmed in the statement that Di Segni will attend the ceremony.\nLazar Berman contributed to this article.",

    "article": "The parents of released hostage Edan Alexander on Tuesday expressed gratitude to US President Donald Trump, Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, and hostage envoy Adam Boehler for their work in bringing their son home.\nThe US brokered the deal with Hamas to release hostage Alexander. He was released from captivity on Monday after 584 days, and was still being observed at Tel Aviv’s Ichilov Hospital, where his parents spoke to the media.\nNeither Yael Alexander, who spoke in Hebrew, nor her husband, Adi Alexander, who delivered his statement in English, mentioned the Israeli government, except to call on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to listen to the country’s call to bring the rest of the hostages home.\n“I say that the return of Edan should be only the beginning of bringing back the rest of the hostages,” said Yael Alexander. “We have no time to wait. Time is running out, and the world is watching us.”\nAdi Alexander added that Witkoff called US officials to share the news that Edan had crossed back into Israel and was safe in his family’s arms.\nWitkoff also arranged a phone call for Edan Alexander with Trump on Tuesday, and participated in Alexander’s call with the prime minister.\nThe couple, standing in the lobby of the hospital, were surrounded by their other two children and other family members, all holding pictures of hostages still in captivity.\nThe Alexanders were both born in Israel and have been living in Tenafly, New Jersey, for the last 20 years.\nEdan, the eldest of their three children, was born in the US and chose to serve in the Israel Defense Forces as a lone soldier when he turned 18 and graduated from his American high school.\nHe is the first male hostage soldier abducted during Hamas’s October 7, 2023, onslaught to be returned to Israel by the terror group.\nAlexander was serving in the IDF’s Golani Brigade at the time of his abduction. He was kidnapped from his base near the Gaza border community of Nirim, known as the White House post, during the attack.\n“President Trump, Steve Witfkoff, and Adam Boehler worked day and night to bring back my son,” said Yael Alexander in her hospital statement.\nOn Sunday, after the Alexanders heard about their son’s imminent release, Yael Alexander flew to Israel with Boehler and his staff, followed by her husband and two children on a commercial flight.\nAdi Alexander said they would never be able to express the meaning Witkoff and Boehler’s work held for them. “We’ll never forget the tireless effort on Edan’s behalf; we are in their debt,” he said.\nYael Alexander also thanked the Israeli public for supporting her and her family in the effort to bring her son home.\n“Most of the public believes that bringing back the hostages is the most important goal, a national and Jewish goal,” she said. “It’s not about the political right or left, but about the human heart.”\nYael Alexander said Edan had told of suffering terrible fears in captivity, and a lack of water, food and other aid. He also described the terror he experienced when the IDF would strike Gaza, destroying buildings.\n“The strikes and bombs made him think that every moment was about to be his last one,” she said. “Edan, my hero, you returned from the horror. But other hostages are still living through that threat, they are still living in that hell. My heart has returned to beating, but they still need to return home.”\nShe said that every day that her son was in captivity was like an eternity.\nAdi Alexander emphasized in English what his wife had said in Hebrew.\n“It’s wonderful to have Edan home,” he said. “It’s a gift from God to watch him hug Yael, his brother and his sister, knowing that his suffering is over and that our family can begin to heal.”\nAdi Alexander said that their son, now 21, will soon return to their home in New Jersey, where he’ll reunite with his friends.\n“Those happy times may include a beer or two,” he said, noting that Edan had already enjoyed his first beer, after months of captivity, on the rooftop of the hospital, a moment that the released hostage also shared on social media.\n“This isn’t just about our family,” said Adi Alexander. “Tomorrow, a new set of negotiations will begin that could lead to more hostages coming home and eventually the end of this war.”\n“For me and my family, the effort to bring home all 58 hostages will continue until they’re all at home,” he added. “Hopefully, these negotiations will lead to that moment.”\nYinon Magal, a leading right-wing political commentator, later lashed out at Yael Alexander for not mentioning Netanyahu among those she thanked, decrying her “repulsive performance of ungratefulness and lack of culture.”\n“Only in the toxic and disturbed atmosphere that the left and media are creating here can this happen,” he wrote on X.\nWhile hosting Channel 14’s “The Patriots,” he also attacked Alexander himself, claiming “the circumstances in which he was kidnapped are problematic.”\nMagal’s remarks were denounced by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum as an “ugly attack” on Alexander and his family.\n“Just as Yael Alexander said this evening: We choose unity, love of mankind and commitment to the values we were raised on. Time has run out, the world is watching and history will remember,” the group said in a statement.\nAlexander returned from captivity with injuries from beatings sustained in the early days of his captivity, Channel 12 news reported, citing the captive’s testimonies since returning.\nAccording to the network, Alexander also had flea bites and bruises all over his body.\nDuring his captivity, he was severely tortured, and for a period, he was kept with a bag over his head. He was only informed he would be released on Monday morning — hours before he was freed.\nFood was scarce during captivity and included pita, rice, and beans, but improved significantly during the January-March ceasefire, when he was fed meat and lamb, according to the report — testimony consistent with those of other hostages who have returned.\nAlexander was considered an “asset” by his captors due to his US citizenship, who nicknamed him “The American,” according to the report.\nAlexander reportedly said he was held in several places, both above ground and inside tunnels. He was guarded by senior Hamas officials who kept him updated on the war and shared details of the brutal massacre the terror group conducted on October 7, 2023.\nIn one instance, Alexander miraculously emerged unharmed after a tunnel in which he was being held collapsed, the report said. The last place he was held was a relatively large tunnel, according to the report.\nHe also saw his family being interviewed and campaigning for his release on television, according to Channel 12.\nTimes of Israel staff contributed to this report.",

    "article": "A ballistic missile launched at Israel by the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen was successfully intercepted by air defenses on Tuesday evening, the military said.\nA 40-year-old woman in Holon was taken by paramedics to Wolfson Medical Center with lower body injuries sustained when she tripped on her way to a bomb shelter, and a 65-year-old woman in Ramat Gan who was lightly injured in the head on the way to a shelter was taken to Ichilov Medical Center, the Magen David Adom ambulance service said.\nSirens had sounded across central Israel and the Jerusalem area. Preceding the sirens by around a minute, an early warning was issued to residents, alerting civilians of the long-range missile attack via a push notification to their phones.\nHours later, another ballistic missile launched from Yemen, apparently aimed at Israel, fell short far from the country, according to an Israeli defense source.\nThe military identified the launch, but no sirens sounded in Israel because the missile did not pose a threat.\nA missile fired from Yemen also fell short of the country on Monday, a defense source said.\nThe attacks came a week after Israel carried out two days of heavy sorties targeting infrastructure controlled by the Houthis in response to a missile that struck Ben Gurion Airport. After Ben Gurion was hit, most foreign airlines suspended flights to Israel.\nHungary-based low-cost airline Wizz Air said Tuesday it expects to resume flight services to and from Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport on May 15, after suspending services following the attack.\nThe fiery Israeli reprisals destroyed the international airport in the capital, Sanaa, and caused heavy damage to a port in Hodeida and several power stations and a cement factory, officials said.\nThe Sanaa airport will resume operations starting Wednesday, the facility’s general said Tuesday.\nOn Sunday, the IDF issued an “urgent” evacuation warning to the three Houthi-controlled ports in western Yemen, though no strikes were reported to follow.\nThe Houthis — whose slogan calls for “Death to America, Death to Israel, [and] a Curse on the Jews” — first began attacking Israel and maritime traffic in November 2023, a month after the October 7 Hamas massacre.\nThe Houthis held their fire when a ceasefire was reached between Israel and Hamas in January 2025. By that point, they had fired over 40 ballistic missiles and dozens of attack drones and cruise missiles at Israel, including one that killed a civilian and wounded several others in Tel Aviv in July, prompting Israel’s first strike in Yemen.\nSince March 18, when the IDF resumed its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis in Yemen have launched 31 ballistic missiles and at least 10 drones at Israel. Several of the missiles have fallen short.\nThe sirens warning of missile attacks have sent hundreds of thousands of Israelis rushing to shelters at all hours of the day and night.",

    "subheading": "Foreign Ministry says famine analysis based on ‘biased data,’ accuses Hamas of hoarding aid; COGAT says study fails to account for 339,000 tons of food aid that entered Gaza",
    "date": "Updated 08:52 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "A global food-security analysis organization assessed on Monday that the overwhelming majority of Gaza’s population is at risk of famine in the coming five months due to Israel’s ongoing blockade preventing humanitarian aid from entering the territory since March 2.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) organization said in a “Special Snapshot” briefing that “the Gaza Strip is still confronted with a critical risk of famine,” and that “the entire population is facing high levels of acute food insecurity, with half a million people [one in five] facing starvation.”\nThe IPC said the analysis was conducted remotely with data from “multiple sources,” and that the “evidence level” for the data was rated “medium.”\nIsrael said in response that “even according to the IPC’s own analysis,” there is currently no famine in Gaza, and noted that previous IPC projections about impending famine have “repeatedly failed to materialize.”\nIn March 2024, IPC predicted that a famine would break out in Gaza by July that year, but no such famine occurred, with food security improving in that period, leading the organization to acknowledge in June that there was indeed no famine.\nCiting the report, UN World Food Programme’s Executive Director Cindy McCain said “families in Gaza are starving” and that it was “imperative” to get aid flowing again.\nA calculation by the WFP regarding the amount of aid currently waiting at the Gaza border and how long it would feed Gazans appeared to indicate, however, that the food that entered Gaza between January 19 and March 2 should suffice for the population’s needs until the middle of July.\nThe IPC’s Special Snapshot, based on data available up to May 6, said its projection marked a “significant deterioration” from what it described as “the already dire situation” in the April 1 to May 10 period.\nIt projected that the entire territory of Gaza would fall into the Phase 4 “Emergency” category between May and September, with some 470,000 people falling into the Phase 5 “Catastrophe” famine category.\nThe document said that acute malnutrition in Gaza was assessed at phases 2 and 3 of its classification system (out of 5) between April 1 to May 10, but that would rise to Phase 4 “critical levels” in North Gaza and the Rafah Governorate from May to September.\nAccording to estimates, however, very few civilians are left in the Rafah Governorate at present.\nThe snapshot also projected that there would be some 70,500 cases of acute malnutrition among children aged 6 to 59 months between April 2025 and March 2026, of which 20% would be severe acute malnutrition.\nThe IPC said that all 25 bakeries supported by the World Food Programme (WFP) in Gaza closed at the beginning of April due to a lack of supplies, and that food stocks for most of the 177 hot meal kitchens “are reportedly exhausted.”\n“Latest data show many households resorting to extreme coping strategies,” the snapshot said. “A third reported collecting garbage to sell for food, while a quarter indicated that no valuable garbage remains.”\nThe organization added that in light of Israel’s declared intention to embark upon a renewed, broad military campaign in Gaza in the coming weeks and the “persistent inability” of humanitarian agencies to deliver essential goods and services, “there is a high risk that Famine [IPC Phase 5]” will occur in the territory between May and September.\nWorld Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the report showed that without “immediate access to food and essential supplies, the situation in Gaza will continue to deteriorate.\n“We do not need to wait for a declaration of famine in Gaza to know that people are already starving, sick and dying, while food and medicines are minutes away across the border,” said Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nHe claimed that since the aid blockade began on March 2, some 57 children have “reportedly died from the effects of malnutrition,” according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.\nCOGAT, a department of Israel’s Defense Ministry, blasted the IPC’s report, saying its previous projections of famine had not materialized and that it had “consistently” projected scenarios that were far worse than what occurred on the ground.\n“The phrase ‘facing famine’ is misleading, as it refers to future scenarios projected by the IPC that have repeatedly failed to materialize since the start of the war and are based on assumptions that have been proven inaccurate and alarmist time and again,” COGAT stated.\nIt accused IPC of a “lack of transparency” with regards to the source of its data, and it said the IPC’s Special Snapshot failed to take into account “the massive volume of aid, especially food, that entered Gaza during the ceasefire.”\nAccording to COGAT, over 25,000 trucks bearing humanitarian aid entered Gaza between January 19 and March 2, carrying some 448,000 tons of aid, 339,000 tons of which was food aid.\nCOGAT said the IPC relies on the UN for its data on aid to Gaza, and that UN agencies counted only a third of the actual aid that entered the territory during the ceasefire.\nIn response to the report, the WFP said on Monday that “more than 116,000 metric tons of food assistance – enough to feed one million people for up to four months — is already positioned in aid corridors.”\nAccording to that metric, however, the 339,000 tons brought into Gaza during the ceasefire should suffice for Gaza’s population of 2.1 million people until the middle of July.\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry said that IPC forecasts were “based on biased data — sourced from Hamas’s ‘Ministry of Health,’” which it said was “known for spreading propaganda,” and accused the terror group of stealing and hoarding aid that had entered the territory.\n“Any conclusions drawn from such politically skewed and methodologically unsound data do not reflect the true humanitarian situation,” the ministry said. “Hamas exploits aid and keeps it in its warehouses to strengthen its control and rebuild its war machine.”",

    "subheading": "Meeting reportedly set for Wednesday, with administration said to be seeking to pull Syria away from Iranian influence, possibly with entry into Abraham Accords",
    "date": "Updated 06:35 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "US President Donald Trump on Tuesday appeared to confirm that he will meet during his swing through Saudi Arabia with interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who may use the opportunity to raise the topic of normalizing ties with Israel.\nLeaving the King Abdul Aziz International Conference Center, Trump stopped for a moment before getting into his limousine to answer a shouted question from a reporter, who asked if he would meet the Syrian president.\nNodding, Trump said, “I think so,” before climbing into the vehicle.\nThe Walla news site reported that a meeting between the two will take place Wednesday, citing unnamed sources with knowledge of the details. It would mark the first time a US president has met a Syrian head of state since 2000, when Bill Clinton met Hafez al-Assad.\nAccording to the London Times, citing unnamed security sources, Sharaa may use the meeting to offer talks on normalizing relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords.\nA US security source confirmed the possibility of Damascus joining the accords, with the United Arab Emirates as a mediator. Sharaa confirmed last week that Abu Dhabi is already acting as an intermediary between Israel and Syria, with talks focusing on security and intelligence matters and confidence-building between the two countries, which have no official relations.\nThe source added that Washington and Gulf countries are seeking to pull Syria away from Iranian influence. Iran, sworn to Israel’s destruction, propped up the former regime of Bashar al-Assad throughout the bloody Syrian civil war.\nIsrael has treated claims by Sharaa’s government that it won’t pose a threat to the region with intense suspicion, due to the new leadership’s roots in Islamism and jihadism.\n“If Syria joins the Abraham Accords and the US uses that as leverage to bring them more to the West, that is a possibility and has been discussed,” the source told The Times.\nSyrian activists and Gulf Arab states have been trying to arrange a meeting between Trump and Sharaa this week on the sidelines of Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.\nSharaa spoke with Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, on Sunday, according to the Syrian presidency.\nThe London Times reported that some in the Trump administration were leaning against a meeting between the two, including National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and Trump’s counter-terrorism adviser Sebastian Gorka. However, US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff was said to favor closer ties with Syria.\nIsrael has been conducting airstrikes in Syria for years in a shadow campaign aimed at weakening Iran and its allies, including the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah, which grew in influence after entering the Syrian civil war on the side of former president Assad.\nIsraeli military operations have persisted since rebels ousted Assad in December, with Jerusalem saying it will not tolerate an Islamist militant presence in southern Syria. Israel has bombed what it says are military targets across the country, and Israeli ground forces have entered southwestern Syria, where they are currently stationed in a number of outposts near the border with the Golan Heights.\nReuters reported in February that Israel has lobbied the US to keep Syria decentralized and isolated, framing its approach around suspicion of Sharaa, who headed a local branch of al-Qaeda before renouncing ties to the group in 2016.\nIsraeli strikes earlier in the month followed days of clashes between Sunni Muslim and Druze gunmen triggered by a voice recording of unclear origin purportedly insulting the Prophet Mohammed, leaving more than two dozen people dead.\nJerusalem has vowed to protect the Syrian Druze, whose coreligionists reside throughout northern Israel, and the IDF has facilitated the evacuation of several Syrian Druze injured in clashes to receive medical treatment in Israel.\nThe fighting was the latest in a string of challenges for Sharaa, who has repeatedly vowed to unite all of Syria’s armed forces under one structure and govern the country, fractured by 14 years of civil war until Assad’s overthrow.\nBut incidents of sectarian violence, notably the killing of hundreds of pro-Assad Alawites in March, have hardened fears among minority groups about the now-dominant Islamists and sparked condemnation from global powers.",

    "subheading": "Challenge to High Court claims London’s decision to supply fighter jet components makes it complicit in alleged crimes against Palestinians in Gaza",
    "date": "Updated 04:54 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "Human rights groups launched a court fight Tuesday challenging the UK government’s decision to supply parts for F-35 fighter jets, saying they are being used by Israel in Gaza in violation of international law.\nThe legal challenge in the High Court in London alleges that the government is breaking domestic and international law and is complicit in atrocities against Palestinians by allowing essential components for the warplanes to be supplied to Israel.\n“There’s such clear evidence of the use of weapons parts from the UK being used in war crimes, including in genocide,” Sacha Deshmukh, chief executive of Amnesty International UK, said at a rally outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London. “Until this case reaches its judgment, right now as we speak, there are significant human rights violations being delivered by British-made weapons and bombs.”\nThe government said in September that it was suspending about 30 of 350 existing export licenses for equipment deemed to be for use in the conflict in Gaza because of a “clear risk” that the items could be used to “commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law.” Equipment included parts for helicopters and drones.\nBut an exemption was made for some licenses related to components of F-35 fighter jets, which have been linked to Israel’s bombardment campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\nRights groups argue that the United Kingdom shouldn’t continue to export parts through what they call a “deliberate loophole,” given the government’s own assessment of Israel’s compliance with international humanitarian law.\nPalestinian human rights organization Al-Haq and the UK-based Global Legal Action Network, which brought the legal challenge, say the components are indirectly supplied to Israel through the global spare parts supply chain.\nAl-Haq had its offices in Ramallah shuttered by Israel in 2022, 10 months after the Defense Ministry designated Al-Haq and several other Palestinian groups as terrorist organizations over their alleged links to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a leftist terror group. The international community has said Israel has failed to provide convincing evidence to back up its claims.\nUK officials have argued that stopping the export of F-35 fighter jet components would endanger international peace and security.\nCompared to major arms suppliers such as the US and Germany, British firms sell a relatively small amount of weapons and components to Israel.\nThe Campaign Against Arms Trade nonprofit group estimates that the UK supplies about 15 percent of the components in the F-35 stealth combat aircraft, including its laser targeting system.\n“British-made F-35s are dropping multi-ton bombs on the people of Gaza, which the UN secretary-general has described as a ‘killing field,'” said Charlotte Andrews-Briscoe, a lawyer for the Global Legal Action Network.\n“The UK government has expressly departed from its own domestic law in order to keep arming Israel. This decision is of continuing and catastrophic effect,” she added.\nThe hearing is expected to last four days, and a decision is expected at a later date.\nThe Hamas-led massacre that sparked the war saw thousands of Gazan terrorists storm southern Israel to kill some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and take 251 hostages.\nThe Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 52,800 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though the toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7.\nIsrael denies violations of international law, saying it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.",

    "date": "Updated 04:14 PM GMT+5:30, May 20, 2025",
    "article": "The BBC is facing calls to sack Gary Lineker rather than letting him leave on his own terms, after the football pundit shared a video on his social media claiming to “explain” Zionism, featuring an image of a rat.\nLineker, the BBC’s highest paid broadcaster, shared the video, titled “Zionism explained in less than two minutes”, on Instagram. It was initially posted by a group called “Palestine Lobby” and features a clip with comments from Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the PLO.\n“They take the land, claim that its theirs and then they make concessions on land that doesn’t actually belong to them”, Ms Buttu states in the clip, going on to say that “the Zionist movement and Zionism on the ground is the idea of creating not only a Jewish state but at the expense of the indigenous Palestinian population. What Zionism is, is the idea of privileging and giving exclusive rights to one group of people at the expense of another group of people…there isn’t a single Zionist who’s able to say that they actually believe that Palestinians have the exact same rights as Israelis who are living in that country.”\nGet The Jewish News Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFree Sign Up\nThe rat emoji appears prominently alongside the title of the video.\nA spokesperson for the Board of Deputies said: “The BBC has allowed the situation with Gary Lineker to continue for far too long. He has caused great offence with this video – particularly with his egregious use of a rat emoji to illustrate Zionists. BBC should ask him to leave now rather than allowing him to dictate his own terms.”\nAlex Hearn, co-director of Labour Against Antisemitism, said: “Gary Lineker has been sharing increasingly extreme content as his fixation has grown, and it was apparent that it was only a matter of time before he crossed the line.\n“Sharing content that uses a rat to demonise the very idea of a Jewish nation state draws directly from Nazi propaganda. It is unfathomable that this is apparently “hateful conduct” on X, but acceptable conduct for the BBC.\n“Lineker made ill-judged comparisons with Germany in the 1930s to further his political point of view, but now he is sharing ideas about Jews popularised in 1930’s Germany. When will enough disrepute be enough for the BBC? It’s time for Lineker to go.”\nEtan Smallman, who originally shared information about Lineker’s actions on Twitter, also referenced the 1930’s analogy, which was used by Lineker in 2023 to describe the then-Home Secretary’s statements on stopping people crossing the English Channel in small boats.\nDavid Hirsh, academic director and CEO of the London Centre for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism, said: “We know Gary Lineker. Nice guy. Never got a yellow card. Our hearts soared when he scored for England. Speaks out against Brexit and against racism. He’s one of us. What absurd over-reach when Jews called him an antisemite! How could he be, he’s a good guy? Now he’s sharing posts that demonise the overwhelming majority of Jews as rats.\n“What’s happening here is that for most liberal Brits, being in the same tribe as Lineker is the important thing. In order to achieve that, they have to say either that this is legitimate, or this is just an understandable exaggeration or stumble: “sure, he shouldn’t have said that, but he’s a footballer not a politician, and this is just his clumsy way of siding with the victims; to accuse the nice guy is a disgraceful way of trying to change the subject.”\nHirsh continued: “The truth is that ‘good people’ in our own political tribe are sometimes antisemitic.”\nLineker has regularly commented on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over the last 18 months. Last year he shared a call for Israel to be banned from international sport, before deleting it from his social media. More recently, he criticised the BBC’s decision to remove a documentary on Gaza found to feature the son of a senior Hamas official, stating that the Corporation had “capitulated to lobbying that they get a lot”\nIn an interview with the New Statesman in December, Lineker stated that he was “not in the slightest bit antisemitic”, but was rather “anti-Israel government”.\nThe post has since been removed from Mr Lineker’s Instagram, but it is unclear whether the BBC will be taking action.\nDanny Cohen, former Director of BBC Television and Controller of BBC One, said: “Gary Lineker appears to have shared content about the Jewish State which echoes 1930’s Nazi propaganda. This is utterly grim. The BBC’s Director General Tim Davie has a simple question to answer: does he tolerate the BBC’s flagship presenters sharing content that has historically been used as an anti-Semitic slur?”\nLast November the BBC confirmed that Mr Lineker would be leaving the BBC’s flagship football show, Match of the Day, at the end of the Premier League season, but confirmed that he would be hosting the Corporation’s coverage of the 2026 World Cup.\nHe is also one of the founders of the Goalhanger podcast production and distribution company, featuring popular podcasts including The Rest is History, The Rest is Politics, Empire and The Rest is Entertainment.\nThe BBC has been approached for comment.\nThank you for helping to make Jewish News the leading source of news and opinion for the UK Jewish community.

    "article": "Freed American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander spoke to US President Donald Trump over the phone on Tuesday in a call made on the phone of US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who arrived at the hospital to visit him.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also spoke by phone with Alexander, his office said, and released a video of the premier during the conversation, during which the former hostage said he was weak, but recovering after his ordeal.\nAlexander was released from captivity in the Gaza Strip on Monday in what has been described as a goodwill gesture from the Palestinian terror group Hamas to Trump ahead of the president’s visit to the region.\nWitkoff and Alexander “had the opportunity to speak with [President Trump], whose leadership made this possible. We remain committed to bringing every last hostage home,” the envoy said in a post from his office on X.\n“I was honored to meet Edan Alexander today and welcome him home. After months in captivity, the world is inspired by his courage and resilience. His return gives hope to so many,” Witkoff added.\nIn his own conversation with Alexander, Netanyahu spoke of the national celebration at his release and asked about his welfare.\n“It is so good to hear you,” Netanyahu said.\n“Amazing, unbelievable,” Alexander was heard responding.\nNetanyahu asked Alexander how he is feeling, to which the latter responded, “Okay. Weak. Slowly, slowly, we’ll get back to the way things were before. It is just a matter of time.”\nNetanyahu told Alexander to hug his parents, who were with him during the call, and that “all of Israel is hugging the three of you. Today we are all one family.”\nDuring the call, Netanyahu also spoke with Witkoff, who praised the Israeli prime minister for his role in enabling the release, which has been seen as a Trump administration achievement rather than an Israeli one.\n“We are very happy for the help that you and President Trump gave us,” Netanyahu told Witkoff, adding that other Israeli soldiers are poised to “take action” if the remaining hostages are not released.\n“Mr. Prime Minister, I told Edan and his family everything that you have done to make this possible over the last several days,” Witkoff responded.\nDescribing the negotiations for Alexander’s release as “tense,” Witkoff said it was “critical” that Netanyahu had “allowed” the talks between the US and Hamas — which Israel was not part of — to take place.\n“That’s a large part of the reason that Edan is home with his family today,” Witkoff said.\nWitkoff mediated that phone call, too, according to a Ynet report. The Prime Minister’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation of the details.\nI was honored to meet Edan Alexander today and welcome him home. After months in captivity, the world is inspired by his courage and resilience. His return gives hope to so many.

Boehler flew to Israel with Alexander’s mother on Sunday as they rushed to be in the country in time for his release.\n“I hope this is a beacon of hope for everybody else,” Witkoff said of the remaining Gaza hostages.\n“Thank God for President Trump. And, by the way, the prime minister [Netanyahu] did an exceptional job here, as did the Qatari PM,” said Witkoff before walking through a scrum of journalists, well-wishers, and security guards.\nPresident Trump envoy @SteveWitkoff tells me: the release of Edan Alexander is a beacon of Hope pic.twitter.com/ftLXbn3dAm\n— Amichai Stein (@AmichaiStein1) May 13, 2025\n“I think there’s a better chance now than before,” to reach a deal with Hamas that sees the remaining 58 hostages in Gaza go free, Boehler said, when asked about the likelihood of a larger deal.\n“I think Hamas knows that they can pull a deal any day that they want. They need to approach Trump, they need to approach [Netanyahu], and they need to set this up the right way,” the envoy added.\nAsked what Israel will decide to do about the war in Gaza after Trump visits the region this week, Boehler replied, “I think that that is up to Israel and they’ll consult with the president. I can’t say.”\n“The one thing I will say is, this is a moment for Israelis. It’s extremely important for Edan Alexander to be put forward, to be released, and I think there is hope of change now,” he said.\nAsked if the US is committed to bringing all hostages back, including non-Americans, Boheler said, “The president has said ‘all the hostages’ and one thing you’ll find with this president is that he sticks with his word.”\nMeanwhile, Alexander’s family notified that he would not fly to Qatar to meet personally with Trump in Saudi Arabia during the president’s trip to the region.\n“The Alexander family confirms that as of now, Edan will not fly to Qatar,” read a statement from the Hostage and Missing Families Forum. “The family remains in continuous contact with the Trump administration.”\nAccording to Hebrew media reports, Alexander is expected to spend at least four days in the hospital, by which time Trump will have departed the region.\nReports on Monday indicated that plans were in the works to have Alexander fly to Qatar at the request of Trump, where he would personally thank the president and the Qatari emir for moves that saw Hamas free him from captivity.\nTrump, whose plane landed Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, is due in Qatar on Wednesday.\nAlexander is expected to meet with Trump later this month at the White House, though a date has not yet been set, Channel 12 reported.\nHis adopted father, Doron Zakser, told the Kan public broadcaster of his great joy at seeing Alexander freed, but also the deep distress he feels over the hostages still in Gaza, while describing the bond that formed between the families of hostages ever since October 7.\n“It is pervasive, it gives no rest,” he said of concern over remaining hostages. “Only when the last one comes back will we say the happiness is complete.”\n“We became one family, there is mutual responsibility,” he said.\nAlexander, the last living hostage with US citizenship, was freed following indirect talks between the US and Hamas. The negotiations sidelined Israeli officials, who were updated only after the deal was struck. The 21-year-old lone soldier had been held in Hamas captivity for 584 days.\nAt the hospital, he is to undergo a series of tests and examinations according to a framework that has been established for all returning hostages, the Walla outlet reported.\nA dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, Alexander was serving in the IDF’s Golani Brigade at the time of his abduction. Hamas kidnapped him from his base near the Gaza border community of Nirim, known as the White House post, during its October 7, 2023, onslaught. Hamas led some 5,600 terrorists to invade southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 others who were taken as hostages to Gaza.\nHamas took 19 male soldiers hostage — not all of them on duty — and seven female surveillance soldiers, the latter of whom have all since been returned to Israel. Five were released in a deal with Hamas, one was rescued, and the body of one was recovered by troops.\nThere are 58 hostages, 35 of whom have been confirmed dead, still held in Gaza.",

    "subheading": "Move designed to register land ownership in Area C of West Bank; Smotrich says act will enable settlement development, and is part of ‘de facto sovereignty revolution’",
    "date": "Updated 12:50 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "The government has approved a cabinet resolution to create a land registration process in Area C of the West Bank, which Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said was designed to “develop settlements” and was part of measures for the “de facto” annexation of the territory.\nUnder the cabinet resolution, a form of executive action, passed on Sunday night, the defense minister will order that “Israeli regional authorities” begin a land registration process and establish an inter-ministerial team prepare to carry out the land registration scheme within 60 days.\nThe resolution also declares that a land registry process being conducted by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank will have no legal validity in Israel, and orders security agencies to thwart the conduct of that registration process.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz who, along with Smotrich, advanced the resolution, lauded the measure, saying that it “does justice for Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria, and will strengthen, consolidate and broaden it.”\nSettler groups and right-wing organizations praised the passage of the resolution as an assertion of Israeli sovereignty and land rights over the West Bank.\nThe Peace Now organization, which campaigns against the settlements, described the land registration initiative as a “mega theft of Palestinian land,” which it said would not enable Palestinians to fairly register their private land and constituted the next step to de facto annexation of the West Bank.\nThe ownership of some two-thirds of all West Bank land has never been formally registered. In Area C, which constitutes some 60% of the entire territory, the figure is similar, with two-thirds registered and one-third not registered, according to Peace Now.\nThe Jordanians began a land registration process when they controlled the West Bank between 1949 and 1967, but that process was halted in 1968 by Israel, after its capture of the territory in the Six Day War the year before.\nSmotrich said that the cabinet resolution was “part of the normalization and de facto sovereignty revolution that we are leading in Judea and Samaria,” and that for the first time “the State of Israel is taking responsibility for the territory as a permanent sovereign.”\nThis, he said, “will create legal certainty, enable land reserves for settlement development,” and prevent what he said were the Palestinian Authority’s efforts “to take over open areas.”\nThe finance minister added that the land registry was part of a broader governmental project to bring in another one million people to live in the West Bank settlements to “strengthen the security belt of the State of Israel, and eliminate the danger of the Palestinian terrorist state.”\nYoni Mizrahi of the Peace Now organization expressed concern that, in light of Smotrich’s comments that the goal of the land registration process was to advance settlement development, it would be extremely hard for Palestinians in Area C to effectively register their private property.\nHe also asserted that under international law, Israel does not have the right to conduct such a land registry given that it holds the West Bank under what is known as a belligerent occupation, in which actions permanently altering the status of the territory are prohibited.\n“If you can conduct a land registration process and control how it is carried out, then this is annexation,” said Mizrahi.\nPeace Now asserted that Israel as the “occupying power” could not be a neutral party to fairly adjudicate land claims, and that Palestinian landowners would not have access to the documents and information in Israel’s possession to prove their ownership rights.\nAs a result, Palestinian landowners face a severe risk of losing title to their land in the registration process, the organization said.\nThe right-wing Regavim organization, which campaigns against illegal Palestinian construction in the West Bank, said that the new land registration process was “a pivotal advancement” in thwarting the Palestinian Authority’s land registration effort.\n“For years, Israel stood idle while the Palestinian Authority aggressively pursued land registration, deploying hundreds of workers and funneling millions of dollars from international sources,” said the organization.   “We extend our gratitude to Defense Minister Israel Katz, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and our esteemed partners, for their resolute leadership in advancing this critical initiative to safeguard our territorial integrity, our land, and secure our collective future.”\nAnd the Yesha Council, an umbrella organization representing settlement municipal authorities around the West Bank, called the measure “fantastic news” for settlements in the West Bank.\n“The land registration in Judea and Samaria is another expression of the change in perception that is so necessary in the area, [that] the State of Israel is the sovereign,” said the organization.",

    "subheading": "The journalist became a hero in Israel and a target at home for her unwavering support after October 7, but her new role on Elon Musk’s X brings its own set of contradictions",
    "date": "Updated 12:09 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "A few hours after touching down in Tel Aviv, Erin Molan stood at the edge of the Mediterranean, scanning the sky. A Houthi missile had recently landed nearby, bringing most air traffic to a standstill.\n“I was looking outside at where it had landed and thinking about the absence of any condemnation for the injured innocent civilians or potential fatalities that could have occurred,” she said. “Every second, every day, I’m reminded of how hypocritical the rest of the world is.”\nOn her third visit to Israel in the past year, Molan was a guest of right-wing organization Nikraim LaDegel (Called to the Flag) at whose “Salute to Israel’s Independence Day” event she spoke on May 5. She also attended the Atlas Awards held by the Ayn Rand Center to receive an award for Moral Courage in recognition of her support for Israel and her commitment to truth in journalism.\nHer schedule was short — just two nights in Tel Aviv — but densely packed with meetings, speeches, and encounters with families whose lives had been upended by war.\nShe recalled meeting a father whose child is still held hostage in Gaza, and a woman whose son was mistakenly shot by an IDF soldier.\n“She held no anger,” Molan said. “That kind of forgiveness, that kind of resilience, stays with you.”\nThe Australian broadcaster, best known until recently for her sharp commentary on sports and politics, has spent the past seven months as one of the world’s most public pro-Israel advocates, highlighting the plight of the hostages and defending Israel’s war in Gaza.\nMolan has found herself increasingly recognized in Israel, where people on the street often flock to her, eager to thank her for her support.\nShe says that while the trip renewed her sense of purpose, she feels conflicted over the public praise.\n“I just tell the truth, and I feel guilty that people feel the need to thank me. It shouldn’t be courageous to say that murdering civilians is evil,” she told The Times of Israel.\nEighteen months ago, Molan was a popular and well-known journalist at Sky News Australia, a subscription-based channel known for its influence in conservative political circles.\nMolan joined the network in 2022 as a primetime contributor and host of a weekly current affairs program, “Erin,” which featured interviews, political commentary, and Molan’s perspectives on domestic and international issues.\nMolan, who is Catholic and had never been to Israel, found her life and career turned upside down following Hamas’s October 7, 2023, massacre, in which terrorists killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in Israel and kidnapped 251 into Gaza.\nStunned by the invasion, she immediately began expressing solidarity, initially on social media and then in broadcast segments.\n“It was never complex to me or grey or fuzzy. It was black and white as to who evil was in this scenario,” she said.\nBut for Molan, it was the responses to the attack that shocked and activated her more than the attack itself.\n“October 7 wasn’t the most horrifying part — it was the world’s reaction to it,” she said.\nA few days after the massacre, before Israel had even mounted a response, Molan watched as crowds gathered in Sydney in celebration of the attack. One rally lit up the Sydney Opera House in which attendees were screaming, among other things, “Gas the Jews.”\n“That was probably the first time I felt genuine shame for my country,” she said. “It was horrific, sickening, gut-wrenching.”\nMolan says that she was “completely naive” about the antisemitism that existed in the West, especially in her native Australia, where some 2,062 antisemitic incidents were recorded between October 2023 and September 2024, compared to 495 incidents a year earlier, according to data from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ).\n“I had absolutely no idea what lay just under the surface.”\nIn a monologue broadcast on Sky News, Molan said, “This is a war not just against Jews but against the West,” she told viewers. “This is a moment where we choose what side we’re on, and if we get it wrong, the consequences will be catastrophic.”\nIn Israel, Molan became something of a sensation — hailed as a rare voice of clarity and compassion in a global media landscape many Israelis saw as indifferent, if not outright hostile.\nBack home in Australia, however, the fallout was swift and more intense than Molan expected.\n“When after a terrorist attack I came out very strongly in support of the victims and staunchly opposed to the terrorists who committed those atrocities, never did I think for a second that I would be considered controversial or in the minority,” she says.\nAs a public figure — one of the first women to anchor a major sports show in Australia — Molan had weathered criticism before, but says this was of a different order.\n“I was the first woman in Australia to host one of the most popular sporting shows, so the abuse and horrific things that were written about me basically because I’m a woman were pretty intense,” she said.\n“Any time a woman is uncompromising in her beliefs or takes a stance that is considered bold, a lot of the world’s reaction is to be uncomfortable with that.”\nAs Molan’s star rose and she became known to audiences the world over for her commentary on Israel, the criticism intensified. She received a torrent of death threats, including some targeted against her 6-year-old daughter.\nThen, quietly and without much explanation, her role at Sky News Australia was cut. In December, she confirmed she was no longer with the broadcaster. Though no explicit reason was given, many are convinced her pro-Israel stance was the deciding factor.\nMolan says that she cares as much about “children suffering in Gaza as children in Israel. I just understand who their real enemy is, which is Hamas.”\n“Peace is the ultimate goal for Israel and for all of us who believe in freedom and democracy, but there is no peace for anyone in this region — including the people of Gaza– whilst Hamas exists.”\nWhile some may have expected her to retreat into obscurity or moderate her tone to appeal to a broader audience, Molan has only become more vocal in her support for Israel.\nShe also found a new platform in the digital space, one less encumbered by editorial constraints. In February 2025, Molan launched a new weekly news program called “69 X Minutes” on Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter), drawing 10 million views on its premiere night.\nShe describes it as “unfiltered, unbiased and raw” — a vehicle for the kind of truth-telling Molan felt mainstream media could no longer accommodate.\nYet her presence on X places her in a complex — and, to some, contradictory — position. Under Musk’s ownership, the platform has amplified extremist voices, reinstated previously banned antisemitic content and allowed white supremacists to flourish. Musk himself has echoed antisemitic conspiracy theories and engaged with known hate accounts.\nFor Molan, a high-profile ally of Israel and outspoken opponent of antisemitism, this alignment raises an obvious paradox: claiming to fight antisemitism on a platform that has done more than almost any other to spread it.\nMolan doesn’t see it that way. She insists that fighting hatred requires going directly to the spaces where it thrives.\n“Existing in an echo chamber is a waste of time,” she says. “You need to be where those antisemitic voices are to fight back.”\nShe argues that platforms like X offer unparalleled reach, and that she’s committed to using the largest megaphone available to “drown those voices out.”\nCertainly, her presence on X has extended her influence far beyond what legacy media once afforded her. Beyond her news channel, Molan has become a highly sought-after speaker in Israel, the United States, and elsewhere, invited to address issues ranging from security to free speech.\nHer interest in national security and public service, she says, stems from her late father, Jim Molan, a highly respected Australian Army major general and senator who led the country’s forces in Iraq during the war.\nThere have even been quiet efforts to encourage her to run for office in Australia — something she has ruled out for now, citing her focus on caring for her daughter.\nWhatever she does next, and despite the death threats, professional setbacks, and having no obvious skin in the game, Molan is adamant that her advocacy for Israel will remain a part of her life.\n“It isn’t just Israel that is under attack — it’s every single thing that I hold dear; it’s my daughter’s future,” she says.\n“I don’t have one iota of doubt that I’m standing on the right side of history.”",

    "article": "BERLIN (AP) — The German government banned this week the largest “Reich citizen” group, an extremist far-right organization that calls itself the “Kingdom of Germany” and seeks to undermine the country’s democratic order.\nFour of its leaders were arrested.\nSince early Tuesday morning, hundreds of security forces in several states have been searching the association’s properties and the homes of leading members.\n“The members of this association have created a ‘counter-state’ in our country and built up economic criminal structures,” Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said, adding that the members of the group underpinned their supposed claim to power with antisemitic conspiracy narratives — a behavior that the country cannot tolerate.\n“We will take decisive action against those who attack our free democratic basic order,” Dobrindt added.\nThe so-called “ Reich citizen, ” or “Reichsbürger,” movement does not recognize Germany as a state. Many of them claim that the historical German Reich still exists and ignore the country’s democratic and constitutional structures such as parliament, laws or courts. They also refuse to pay taxes, social security contributions or fines.\nThe so-called “Kingdom of Germany” was proclaimed by its leader Peter Fitzek — who was among those arrested on Tuesday — in the eastern town of Wittenberg in 2012 and says it has around 6,000 followers, the interior ministry said in a statement. It claims to be a “counter-state” that seceded from the German federal government.\nThe group’s online platforms will be blocked and its assets will be confiscated to ensure that no further financial resources can be used for extremist purposes.\nIt’s not the first time that Germany has acted against the “Reichsbürger” movement.\nIn 2023, German police officers searched the homes of about 20 people in connection with investigations into the far-right Reich Citizens scene, whose adherents had similarities to followers of the QAnon movement in the United States.\nLast year, the alleged leaders of a suspected far-right plot to topple Germany’s government went on trial in a case that shocked the country.",

    "date": "Updated 11:07 AM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "A British left-wing activist is facing deportation from Israel after police arrested her Monday morning in the West Bank’s South Hebron Hills.\nJanet Adyeri, 35, was arrested after entering a closed military zone in at-Tuwani, Palestinian village near the West Bank settlement of Ma’on. Police said they detained Adyeri after she refused orders to identify herself and threatened the settlement’s security coordinator who arrived at the scene.\n“The suspect was questioned in the investigations and intelligence unit of the West Bank District and brought before a judge,” police said in a statement.\nDuring the interrogation, officers apparently discovered that she had “uploaded social media posts against police and IDF soldiers, and was part of an organization calling to boycott the State of Israel.”\n“In the wake of what came up during the investigation, [the Population and Immigration Authority] decided to deport her,” the statement continued.\nAdyeri’s lawyer, Riham Nasra, said she was never interrogated regarding her social media posts or making threats. Nasra said she was “questioned regarding her entry into a closed military zone, and that’s it.”\nAccording to Adyeri’s version of events, she had only refused to identify herself when asked by a soldier out of uniform, not understanding he had the authority to demand her passport. She presented identification to uniformed soldiers later on, Nasra said.\nThe activist’s attorney further insisted that she had not been brought before a judge, as police claimed, and was instead taken straight to to a hearing at the Population and Immigration Authority in Ramle by Hebron police officers, where her deportation was decided upon.\n“The options they gave her after they held the [deportation] hearing was to wait in detention for three more days to go before a judge,” or to leave the country without a hearing, Nasra said. She chose the latter.\nAdyeri is currently being held in Ramle’s Givon Prison pending her departure, Nasra added. She is expected to leave the country tomorrow.\nThe incident is one of a number in the past year in which authorities have deported foreign activists working with Palestinians in the West Bank.\nAccording to figures published by Haaretz, at least 16 activists were deported since October 2023 after being detained in the West Bank on various suspicions.\nNational Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who oversees police, welcomed the development in a post to his X social media account, writing, “Anyone who acts against Israel will find themselves facing an aggressive police.”\n“The fun and games are over!” Ben Gvir said.\nLast year the Ynet outlet reported that Ben Gvir, who leads the ultranationalist Otzma Yehudit party, had set up a special police team to arrest Israeli left-wing activists in the West Bank and the visiting foreign activists they cooperate with. It is unclear if the special team was involved in Adyeri’s arrest.\nAn anonymous security official who spoke to the outlet was cited as saying the team would focus on “first, foreign nationals who come here from all over the world straight to the territories and create provocations against IDF soldiers. Second, tourists who come here under the guise of a visit, but end up at the same areas of tension in Judea and Samaria. Third, Israeli citizens who confront IDF soldiers.”\nIsrael has also been trying to prevent foreign activists from entering the country, including lawmakers.\nLast month, authorities canceled visas for 27 French left-wing lawmakers and local officials two days before they were to arrive for a visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories, the trip organizers said.\nThe Interior Ministry said at the time the visas for the 27 were canceled under a law that allows authorities to ban people who could act against the state.\nEarlier in April, authorities detained British members of parliament Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed at Ben Gurion Airport and deported them, citing the same reason. Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the action “unacceptable.”\nIn February, Israel stopped two left-wing European parliament deputies, Franco-Palestinian Rima Hassan and Lynn Boylan from Ireland, from entering.",

    "article": "A Palestinian photojournalist whom the Israeli military has said was a member of the Hamas terror group operating under journalistic cover was killed in a strike on operatives based in a hospital in the southern Gaza Strip early Tuesday.\nIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said it carried out a “targeted strike” on “key Hamas terrorists” who were operating out of a command center at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis.\n“The compound was being used by the terrorists to plan and carry out terror attacks against forces and Israeli civilians,” the military said.\nPalestinian media reported multiple casualties in the strike, among them Hassan Eslaiah.\nEslaiah, whose freelance photography was distributed around the world for the Associated Press, entered Israel during the October 7, 2023, massacre, photographing Gazans, some of them armed, as they stormed Kibbutz Nir Oz, where a quarter of the population was slaughtered or kidnapped, including the elderly and children as young as nine months old.\nHe also took a picture of Gazans atop a burning tank next to the destroyed Gaza border fence. A video from the scene posted to social media and since deleted showed him next to the tank; no press credentials could be seen on him.\nLast month, the IDF announced that it had targeted Eslaiah in an airstrike, but he managed to survive. Palestinian media reported that Eslaiah was receiving medical care at Nasser Hospital from injuries sustained in the previous strike when he was killed.\nAt the time of the previous strike, the IDF and Shin Bet security service said Eslaiah was a member of Hamas’s Khan Younis Brigade and was operating “under the guise of a journalist and owner of a press company.”\nBoth the AP and CNN said in November 2023 that they had severed their relationship with Eslaiah after a pro-Israel watchdog raised questions about their work with the photographer and other journalists who entered Israel during the massacre.\nHis pictures from that day were removed from the Associated Press’s distribution feed, though others remain.\nThe agency has denied that Eslaiah and other Gazan journalists it worked with who entered Israel during the attack had any advance knowledge of the attack.\nThe report by the Honest Reporting monitoring group had also raised questions about Eslaiah’s relationship with Hamas, reproducing a since-deleted photo posted by him in 2020 showing the terror group’s chief, Yahya Sinwar, embracing him and kissing his cheek.\nIsrael has repeatedly alleged that journalists killed in strikes were actually terror operatives who posed as reporters; it maintains that Hamas uses hospitals, schools, shelters, and aid infrastructure as cover for terror activities.\nIn the hours following our expose, new material is still coming to light concerning Gazan freelance journalist Hassan Eslaiah whom both AP & CNN used on Oct. 7.\nHere he is pictured with Hamas leader and mastermind of the Oct. 7 massacre, Yahya Sinwar. https://t.co/S9pXeIGaFq pic.twitter.com/RmEZU5RsM8\n— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting) November 8, 2023\nThe military said that Nasser Hospital was previously used by Ismail Barhoum, a senior Hamas official, who was killed in a strike on the same building at the medical center in March.\nBarhoum was a member of Hamas’s political bureau, chief of the terror group’s finances, and the successor to Issam Da’alis, the de facto prime minister of Gaza, who was also killed in March.\nأثار قصف طائرات الاحتلال قسم الحروق في مستشفى ناصر، واغتيال الزميل الشهيد الصحفي حسن إصليح، خلال تلقيه العلاج من إصابة سابقة. pic.twitter.com/I8gLLGVmjT\n— Newpress | نيو برس (@NewpressPs) May 13, 2025\n“Senior Hamas terrorist organization officials continue to use the hospital for terror purposes, cynically and cruelly exploiting the civilian population in and around the hospital,” the IDF statement said Tuesday.\nThe military said it took “numerous steps” to mitigate civilian harm in the strike, including by using a precision munition, aerial surveillance, and other intelligence.\nצה\"ל תקף לפני זמן קצר באופן ממוקד מחבלים מרכזיים בארגון הטרור חמאס, שפעלו במתחם פיקוד ושליטה שהוקם במרחב בית חולים 'נאצר' במרחב ח'אן יונס. המתחם שימש את המחבלים לתכנון ולהוצאה לפעול של מתווי טרור נגד כוחות ואזרחי מדינת ישראל.\nממתחם בית החולים 'נאצר' פעל מחליפו של ראש ממשלת חמאס… pic.twitter.com/t9G5kY8oCG\n— צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) May 13, 2025\nThe strike came following a brief pause in Israeli military activity in the Gaza Strip, which was to enable the release of hostage soldier Staff Sgt. Edan Alexander from Hamas captivity on Monday.\nIn recent days, the IDF has been gearing up for a planned major offensive in the Gaza Strip, which officials said would be launched if no hostage deal is reached with Hamas by the end of US President Donald Trump’s visit to the region on May 16.\nTerror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 58 hostages, including 57 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF.\nAccording to Israeli officials, the planned offensive, dubbed “Gideon’s Chariots,” would see the IDF “conquering” Gaza and retaining the territory; moving the Palestinian civilian population toward the south of the Strip; attacking Hamas; and preventing the terror group from taking control of humanitarian aid supplies.",

    "article": "The US military is replacing its B-2 bombers with another type of bomber at a base in the Indo-Pacific that was seen as being in an ideal location to operate in the Middle East, US officials told Reuters on Monday, as the American bombing campaign against Yemen’s Houthi rebel group came to an end with a ceasefire reached earlier this month.\nThe Pentagon deployed as many as six B-2 bombers in March to a US-British military base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, making use of the aircraft during the month-long US bombing campaign in Yemen and as a deterrence against Iran during a period of tensions as the two countries began talks over Tehran’s nuclear program.\nExperts say that this had put the B-2s, which have stealth technology and are equipped to carry the heaviest US bombs and nuclear weapons, in a position to operate in the Middle East.\nThe officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the B-2 bombers were being replaced by B-52 bombers.\nThe Pentagon said it did not comment on force posture adjustments as a matter of policy.\nThe original deployment represented nearly a third of all the B-2 bombers in Washington’s arsenal. It was seen as highly unusual to see that many at one base abroad.\nTypically, so-called show of force missions involving the B-2 have seen two or three of the aircraft conduct operations in foreign territory, very rarely seeing as many as six in one place.\nThe B-2 bombers had been used to carry out strikes against the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group in Yemen, as the US executed dozens of bombing missions against the group beginning in mid-March, targeting the Houthis over their attacks on shipping in Mideast waters in support of Hamas in the war sparked by the terror group’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.\nAfter more than a month of intensive airstrikes, US President Donald Trump announced last week that a deal had been reached with the Houthis, with the group agreeing to halt attacks on US vessels in exchange for a reprieve from US strikes.\nHowever, the deal still allows the Houthis to keep up their missile and drone attacks on Israel, which have continued near-daily since the agreement with the US was signed.\nAlso contributing to the lowering tensions in the region are the developments with the US-Iran nuclear talks, with both sides planning to continue weekly meetings\nThe fourth round of talks took place on Sunday, ahead of Trump’s planned visit to the Middle East. Trump, who has threatened military action against Iran if diplomacy fails, has restored a “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran since returning to the White House in January.\nBoth sides had reported progress in the previous three rounds, and on Sunday, Iran said the meeting was “difficult but useful,” while a senior US official said Washington was “encouraged.”\nTehran is willing to negotiate some curbs on its nuclear work in return for the lifting of sanctions, according to Iranian officials, but ending its enrichment program or surrendering its enriched uranium stockpile are among what the officials have called “Iran’s red lines that could not be compromised” in the talks.\nWestern countries, including the United States, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, while Tehran insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.\nIran currently enriches uranium to 60 percent purity — far above the 3.67% limit set in the 2015 deal with the United States and other world powers, and a short technical step from the 90% needed for weapons-grade material. Tehran regularly threatens to destroy Israel, and its uranium enrichment level is far higher than necessary for civilian uses.\nIsrael is reportedly unhappy with the state of the talks, which were said to be developing into a largely similar framework to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, which was signed by then-US president Barack Obama and was panned at the time by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as disastrous for Israel. Trump also maligned that accord before withdrawing from it in 2018.\nNetanyahu, who is deeply skeptical of the Iran-US talks, has called for all of Tehran’s nuclear facilities to be dismantled and for its ballistic missile program to be stopped as part of any credible deal.\nTehran has insisted that the talks be solely focused on the nuclear issue and the lifting of sanctions, ruling out negotiations on military capabilities.",

    "article": "US President Donald Trump’s sudden announcement of a truce with Yemen’s Houthi rebels after two months of an intense bombing campaign came because the military operation was struggling and showed no sign of reaching an imminent conclusion, the New York Times reported Monday, citing US officials.\nAccording to the report, though US airstrikes caused some damage, the Houthis had moved significant assets to underground bunkers, limiting the offensive’s effects, and were still firing back at US Navy ships when Trump declared the ceasefire.\nIt quoted three US officials as saying that Gen. Michael E. Kurilla, the head of Central Command, had proposed a campaign of eight to 10 months in which strikes would take out Houthi air defense systems, after which the US would use targeted assassinations — modeled on Israel’s campaign against the Hezbollah terror group in Lebanon.\nWhile the Saudis backed the plan and provided a list of a dozen top Houthi officials for assassination, the United Arab Emirates was more wary, the report said.\nTrump eventually approved strikes on air defense and Houthi leaders. But the US president, who has a low tolerance for extended military campaigns in the Middle East, gave the military just 30 days to come up with results.\nAt 31 days and a $1 billion bill, the president asked for a progress report, administration officials said. But it showed that the US was heading into an expensive, indefinite military campaign.\nVoices in the intelligence community noted that though there was “some degradation” of the Houthis’ abilities, the group could easily regain them, the report said, citing unnamed officials.\nThe Houthis had shot down several multi-million dollar US drones and were still firing at naval ships, among them an aircraft carrier. Some Pentagon planners were concerned that the number of precision munitions used was depleting stockpiles that might be needed elsewhere.\nUS officials said that aside from the seven MQ-9 drones the Houthis shot down — each with a $30 million price tag — the Yemeni group nearly hit several F-16 jets and an F-35 stealth fighter, raising the specter of US casualties.\nOn April 28, the USS Truman aircraft carrier was forced to make a sharp turn to avoid Houthi fire, several officials said, a move that caused, in part, a fighter jet to fall overboard. Over the next week, a Houthi missile hit Ben Gurion airport in Israel, and another F-18 jet fell overboard from the aircraft carrier.\nA US official said that in late April, a video call between US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Saudi and Emirati officials did not produce agreement on how to move forward.\nAmerican and Arab officials said that Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy, brought up an Omani suggestion that the US stop the bombing, and the Houthis would agree to halt firing at US ships in the Red Sea as an offramp.\nThe deal would not include an agreement to stop firing at other shipping that the Houthis see as tied to Israel, a campaign, along with the direct attacks on Israel, that the Iran-backed group launched in support of Gaza amid the ongoing war there.\nBy May 5, Trump was ready to end the campaign, according to over a dozen current and former officials with knowledge of talks in the president’s national security circle. His announcement of a truce with the Houthis came two days later.\nHouthis and their supporters spread the news on social media with the hashtag, “Yemen defeats America.”\nA White House spokeswoman said in a statement to The New York Times that “President Trump successfully delivered a cease-fire, which is another good deal for America and our security.”\nAccording to the NYT, the developments indicated that some in the US national security team underestimated the tenacity of the Houthis and overestimated Trump’s willingness to engage in a military conflict in the Middle East.\nIt noted that during his first term, Trump had worked to bring US troops home from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq.\nIn addition, Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as his predecessors, had worried that fighting the Houthis would draw resources from the Asia-Pacific region.\nTrump’s sudden halt to the campaign had surprised Israel, which was still carrying out its own strikes against the Houthis.\nThe Houthis — whose slogan calls for “Death to America, Death to Israel, [and] a Curse on the Jews” — first began attacking Israel and maritime traffic in November 2023, a month after the October 7 Hamas massacre.\nThe Houthis held their fire when a ceasefire was reached between Israel and Hamas in January 2025. By that point, they had fired over 40 ballistic missiles and dozens of attack drones and cruise missiles at Israel, including one that killed a civilian and wounded several others in Tel Aviv in July, prompting Israel’s first strike in Yemen.\nSince March 18, when the IDF resumed its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis have launched some 29 ballistic missiles and at least 10 drones at Israel.\nThe sirens warning of missile attacks have sent hundreds of thousands of Israelis rushing to shelters at all hours of the day and night.\nOn May 4, two days before Trump announced his truce with the Yemeni terror group, a Houthi ballistic missile beat Israel’s defenses and impacted inside the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, causing damage and minor injuries, and prompting most foreign airlines to institute an ongoing suspension of Israel flights.",

    "article": "WASHINGTON (AP) — US President Donald Trump set out on a three-nation visit to the Middle East on Monday, a trip he had originally intended to use to focus on his efforts to press wealthy Gulf nations to pour billions in new investment into the United States.\nBut now Trump finds himself navigating a series of geopolitical crises — and searching for glimmers of hope in the deep well of global turmoil — that are casting greater import on the first extended overseas trip of his second term.\n“This world is a lot safer today than it was a week ago,” Trump crowed to reporters as he sized up the foreign policy challenges he’s facing as he heads to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. “And a lot safer than it was six months ago.”\nThe president was brimming with an overabundance of confidence about some of the world’s most intractable problems, from tensions in South Asia to the future of sanctions in Syria to the war in Ukraine.\nBut behind closed doors, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Qatar Emir Sheikh Tamim al-Thani, and Emirati President Mohammed bin Zayed will be looking to get a bead on how Trump intends to push ahead on resolving the war in Gaza, dealing with Iran’s rapidly progressing nuclear program and addressing India-Pakistan tensions.\nAnd after weeks of threats and cajoling, it remains to be seen if Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will listen to Trump, who is demanding they meet in Istanbul this week to discuss ending Russia’s war on Ukraine.\nTrump, for his part, projected confidence that the meeting will happen and even seemed somewhat optimistic that the end to the conflict is near. He floated the idea of making a detour from his itinerary to visit Turkey if he thinks his presence would be constructive.\n“I was thinking about flying over. I don’t know where I am going be on Thursday,” Trump said. “I’ve got so many meetings. … There’s a possibility there, I guess, if I think things can happen.”\nBut Ukraine’s allies remained deeply skeptical Monday about prospects for talks and whether Putin was serious about peace.\n“If there is no ceasefire there cannot be talks under fire,” European Union Commission Vice President Kaja Kallas told reporters at a meeting on Ukraine in London. “We want to see that Russia also wants peace. It takes two to want peace, it takes only one to want war, and we see that Russia clearly wants war.”\nJust as Trump was preparing to depart Washington for the Saudi capital of Riyadh, the last living American hostage in Gaza, Edan Alexander, was released.\nTrump and administration officials framed the moment — a goodwill gesture toward Trump by Hamas — as a chance to get foundering peace negotiations between Israel and Hamas back on track.\n“This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved one,” Trump posted on social media after Hamas extended the offer Sunday. “Hopefully, this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict.”\nWhile Trump pumped up Alexander’s release as a potential turning point, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was far more subdued. Israel, notably, has not stepped back from plans to expand its war in Gaza.\nNetanyahu’s office, in a statement Monday, underscored it had “not committed to a ceasefire of any kind or the release of terrorists” in exchange for Alexander.\n“The negotiations will continue under fire, during preparations for an intensification of the fighting,” the prime minister’s office statement said.\nAs he prepared to leaved Washington, Trump also said he’s weighing removing sanctions on the Syrian government. It’s an issue that’s top of mind for the three Gulf leaders, who have rallied behind the new government in Damascus and will want Trump to follow through.\n“We may want to take them off of Syria, because we want to give them a fresh start,” said Trump, adding that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has urged him to do so.\nThe comments marked a striking change in tone from Trump, who has been deeply skeptical of Syrian President Ahmed Al-Sharaa.\nAl-Sharaa took power after his Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), led an offensive that toppled former President Bashar Assad in December.\nThe Trump administration has yet to formally recognize the new Syrian government. Sanctions imposed on Damascus under Assad also remain in place.\nTrump also took credit for his administration keeping India and Pakistan from returning to a state of all-out war amid the deadliest fighting in six years between the nuclear-armed neighbors.\nThe president said he and aides were ultimately able to talk sense to India and Pakistan’s leadership and guide them away from further escalation by dangling carrots, while also threatening both nations with sticks.\n“I said, ‘Come on, we’re going to do a lot of trade with you guys,’” Trump said. “’If you stop it, we’ll do trade. If you don’t stop it, we’re not going to do any trade.’ People never use trade the way I used it.”\nThe situation remains tenuous. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Monday that his country has only “paused” its military action and will “retaliate on its own terms” if there is any future terror attack on the country.\nThe president will arrive in the region after his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, held the fourth round of nuclear talks Sunday in Oman with Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi.\nAs the talks continue, the Trump administration has sent mixed messages about what nuclear work Iran would be allowed to do under a potential deal.\nSenior administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have said that Tehran would be required to import enriched material to run nuclear reactors for civilian purposes. Trump, however, said this past week that his administration hasn’t made a decision on the issue.\nIt’s also unclear if Trump will insist that Tehran give up support of Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Houthi militants in Yemen as part of any nuclear deal.\nWhatever his negotiating frame may be, Trump seemed confident that Iran is engaging rationally, and that he will cement a deal soon.\n“You can’t have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said of his demand for Iran. “But I think that they are talking intelligently.”\nHowever, the two sides still appear a long way from any deal, even as time passes on a two-month deadline imposed by Trump.",

Avichay Adraee, publishes a map of the area that is to be evacuated, saying that it is a “final warning” before the IDF carries out strikes there.\nThree rockets were launched in the attack claimed by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The IDF said two rockets were intercepted and one hit an open area.\n#عاجل ‼️ إلى جميع سكان قطاع غزة المتواجدين في بلدية جباليا، معسكر جباليا وأحياء تل الزعتر، الشيخ زايد، النور، السلام والروضة????هذا انذار مسبق وأخير قبل الهجوم!????⭕️سيهاجم جيش الدفاع بقوة شديدة كل منطقة يتم إطلاق قذائف صاروخية منها. ⭕️تتحمل المنظمات الارهابية وفي مقدمتها حماس… pic.twitter.com/ZPlJg1kZ8L\n— افيخاي ادرعي (@AvichayAdraee) May 13, 2025\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says the premier plans to hold a cabinet meeting in the City of David this upcoming Jerusalem Day on May 26, confirming earlier reports.\n“The Israeli government is proud to hold its special cabinet meeting marking Jerusalem Day in the City of David – the cradle of our national heritage and the very heart of our united and eternal capital,” writes the Prime Minister’s Office in a statement.\nThe PMO also rejects a Walla report that the Shin Bet security agency is concerned about the meeting taking place amid the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan, where the City of David is located.\n“Contrary to the false [Walla] report, the Shin Bet raised no objections to holding the event in the City of David. On the contrary, preliminary checks and coordination were conducted with Shin Bet security officials, who approved the event at this location,” the PMO says.\nEarlier, Walla reported that the Shin Bet had expressed concern over its ability to secure a cabinet meeting at the archaeological site and national park, as well as provide the necessary protection for the prime minister and other ministers to reach the location.\nThe Shin Bet recommended finding an alternate spot, but officials in the PMO nevertheless instructed the security services to prepare a plan for securing the cabinet meeting in the City of David, the report said.\nJerusalem Day, which celebrates Israel’s capture of the Old City and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Six Day War, starts this year on May 25 in the evening and continues until May 26 in the evening.\nUnited Nations aid chief Tom Fletcher slams a plan by Israel and the United States for the distribution of aid in the Gaza Strip as a “cynical sideshow, a deliberate distraction, a fig leaf for further violence and displacement.”\nHe tells the UN Security Council that no food, medicine, water or tents have entered the war-torn enclave for more than 10 weeks.\n“We can save hundreds of thousands of survivors. We have rigorous mechanisms to ensure our aid gets to civilians and not to Hamas, but Israel denies us access, placing the objective of depopulating Gaza before the lives of civilians,” claims Fletcher.\nThe IDF and Shin Bet confirm killing Hassan Eslaiah in a strike on Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza overnight, saying he was a Hamas operative “operating under the guise of a journalist.”\nOn October 7, 2023, Eslaiah, who was freelancing for the Associated Press, took photos of a burning tank on the Gaza border after it was attacked by Hamas operatives. He also invaded Israel with the terrorists and photographed them entering Kibbutz Nir Oz, where dozens of civilians were massacred.\nThe IDF has said he was a member of Hamas’s Khan Younis Brigade.\nA Palestinian man was struck in the head this evening by settlers while in Khirbet a-Dab’a in the South Hebron Hills region of the West Bank, an eyewitness tells The Times of Israel.\nHe was evacuated to a hospital with a head injury.\nAccording to the eyewitness, who speaks on condition of anonymity, around 7 p.m., around 10 masked settlers arrived at the scene and attacked Palestinians. It is unclear whether the Palestinian was injured by stones or by clubs carried by the settlers.\nIn addition, according to the same eyewitness, earlier today, around 10 masked settlers also arrived near the village of a-Tuwani in the South Hebron Hills and attempted to attack Palestinians.\nIn footage obtained by The Times of Israel, a masked individual can be seen throwing stones while an IDF soldier beside him fires into the air. According to the witness, several soldiers were present during the incident, and two Palestinians were injured by stones and evacuated to a hospital for medical treatment.\nThe IDF has not yet issued a response.\nבינתיים בדרום הר חברון רעולי פנים מיידים אבנים לעבר א-תוואני. שני פלסטינים נפצעו. מאוחר יותר הגיעה קבוצה דומה לחילת א-דבע ופלסטיני נפצע קשה בראשו, לא ברור אם מאבן או מאלה. כאן בתיעוד מא-תוואני חיילים ליד רעולי הפנים יורים באוויר ואז מרחיקים אותם מהמקום. מצה\"ל טרם נמסרה תגובה. pic.twitter.com/AwI7ZDEzyy\n— Nurit Yohanan (@nurityohanan) May 13, 2025\nإصابتان برصاص مستوطنين في خلة الضبع شرق مدينة يطا جنوب الخليل pic.twitter.com/gNHx2UKa5q\n— خبرني – khaberni (@khaberni) May 13, 2025\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group claims responsibility for the rockets fired from Gaza toward Ashkelon and Sderot.\nA statement from the organization says it launched rockets in response to “Zionist massacres.”\nThe attack came shortly after a series of IDF airstrikes that sources say targeted Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met this evening with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at the premier’s office in Jerusalem, the Prime Minister’s Office says in a statement, without detailing the meeting’s content.\nFollowing his state visit to Berlin, President Isaac Herzog arrived in Israel with Steinmeier this morning, kicking off a reciprocal visit by the German head of state.\nSteinmeier received the Presidential Medal of Honor from Herzog at a ceremony held this evening.\nHussein al-Sheikh, who was recently named by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas as the Palestine Liberation Organization’s deputy head, meets with Emirati Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed in the United Arab Emirates.\nAccording to a statement by the UAE foreign ministry, the two discussed developments in the region, including the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip.\nFollowing the Abraham Accords four years ago, the Palestinian Authority boycotted the UAE, which led to a crisis between the sides. Even after the return of the PA’s representative to the Emirates, relations remained tense, and according to reports, the UAE has expressed opposition to the immediate return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza.\nعبدالله بن زايد يستقبل معالي حسين الشيخ، نائب رئيس اللجنة التنفيذية لمنظمة التحرير الفلسطينية ونائب رئيس دولة فلسطين، حيث تم بحث مجمل التطورات الراهنة في المنطقة وتداعياتها المختلفة، لا سيما الأزمة الانسانية المتفاقمة في قطاع غزة. pic.twitter.com/J2VWcEjJzh\n— OFM (@OFMUAE) May 13, 2025\nUS Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff told the families of hostages held in Gaza earlier today that Hamas is “afraid of Donald Trump” and “should be.”\nIn brief footage from the lengthy meeting he and US hostage envoy Adam Boehler held with the families in Tel Aviv, broadcast on Kan TV, Witkoff relates that newly released hostage Edan Alexander is “doing better than I would have thought. They actually treated him better. So for those who have relatives who are alive, I think that’s an important data point.”\nWitkoff elaborates: “Edan told me that when the president was elected, he began to get treated well. And that’s a really interesting data point — that people evidently are being treated better there, because Hamas is afraid of Donald Trump. And the truth is, they should be.”\nIn a separate audio clip broadcast on Channel 12, Witkoff is heard telling the families that if a diplomatic deal cannot be reached to solve the hostage crisis, it will be one of the worst failures of his life.\n“The last thing I wanted to do was to call the Alexander family and give them notice of this thing,” Witkoff says, referring to Edan’s release, “because we thought six weeks ago we were getting him out, by the way, and he was going to be part of a larger release. And we were close. And, like that, it didn’t happen.”\nNow, says Witkoff, “everything is moving in the direction of: create a deal to diplomatically solve it. And if we can’t diplomatically solve it, it’s going to be, in my view — I’m not going to speak for Adam, okay — but to me, it will be one of the worst failures that I can ever endure in my life.”\nתיעוד בלעדי מתוך דברי ויטקוף למשפחות החטופים: \"חמאס התייחס לעידן טוב יותר מאז בחירת טראמפ\" | @SuleimanMas1 עם המסר המעודד#מהדורתכאןחדשות pic.twitter.com/X7RUOFyHdH\n— כאן חדשות (@kann_news) May 13, 2025\nChannel 12 also reports that Alexander, on his release yesterday, immediately told Israeli officials and Witkoff that Matan Zangauker must be urgently returned. He was held with Zangauker for the past eight months, the report says.\nZangauker’s mother, Einav, has said they were held together in the same tunnel, with no other hostages.\nEdan’s report on Matan was conveyed to Einav, the TV report says, leaving her in tears and more worried than ever for her son, who has medical issues.\nThree rockets were launched from the Gaza Strip at southern Israel a short while ago, the military says.\nTwo of the projectiles were intercepted by air defenses, while the third hit an open area, the IDF adds.\nThere are no injuries.\nA ballistic missile launched from Yemen a short while ago, apparently aimed at Israel, fell short far from the country, according to an Israeli defense source.\nThe military identified the launch, but no sirens sounded in Israel because the missile did not pose a threat.\nIt is the second missile launch from Yemen this evening, with the first triggering sirens in central Israel and Jerusalem before being intercepted.\nSince March 18, when the IDF resumed its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis have launched some 32 ballistic missiles and at least 10 drones at Israel. Many of the missiles have fallen short.\nEdan Alexander has told his family that he endured torture and was bound some of the time he was held in captivity in Gaza, with his head covered so he couldn’t see, the Ynet news site reports.\nThe hostage has reportedly said his first days of captivity were “hell,” with Israeli strikes making him fear for his life. On one occasion, a tunnel where he was being held collapsed, but he managed to escape unscathed.\nAlexander was held by senior Hamas officials and was regarded as an “asset” due to his American citizenship, the report says, adding that he was periodically updated about developments in the war and watched many interviews his parents gave on TV.\nMost of the time, he ate rice, pita bread and beans, but the menu also included meat during ceasefires, Ynet reports, saying Alexander returned with bruises and many flea bites.\nRocket sirens are sounding in Ashkelon, Sderot and other nearby communities close to the border with the Gaza Strip.\nThe IDF says it is looking into the details.\nWhile visiting former American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander at Tel Aviv’s Sourasky Hospital this morning, US special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff gifted the 21-year-old a necklace that had belonged to Witkoff’s son, Andrew, who died in 2011, Channel 12 reports.\nIn a gesture that “moved Edan’s family to tears,” Witkoff handed over the keepsake — which the envoy had worn himself  — to Alexander, a day after helping secure his freedom from Hamas, the network says.\n“You would be doing a great honor to my son if you keep wearing this,” Witkoff reportedly told Alexander, as he placed the necklace around the dual national’s neck.\nUN spokesman Stephane Dujarric tells reporters that the easing of US sanctions on Syria — as announced today by US President Donald Trump — “is a positive development, inviting a broader investment” in the country.\nThe lifting of sanctions will help the reconstruction of Syria and “help the Syrian people recover from more than a decade of conflict, a decade of underinvestment,” Dujarric says. It will put more of a focus “on economic development, on private businesses and investment.”\nThe United Nations will continue to support Syria’s reconstruction, whether it’s physical or psychological, “for it to be a country where all Syrians of all faiths, of all ethnicities and minorities feel safe and represented.” Dujarric says.\nUS President Donald Trump told freed American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander that the American public “can’t wait” to see him return to the country, during a 10-minute phone call with the ex-captive and with US special envoy Steve Witkoff this morning, Channel 12 reports.\n“Your mother kept pushing me the whole time — but that’s okay. I can’t wait to see you in the White House. The whole nation wants to see you. You’re a bigger celebrity than me right now. Enjoy it while you can, stay strong. Take it easy,” Trump said to Alexander, according to the network, which reports in Hebrew on the English-language conversation.\n“Steve [Witkoff ] did a great job. Honestly, it was me, but I’ll give Steve the credit,” Trump continued.\nWhen asked by the president how his captors treated him, Edan Alexander says: “Since you got elected, my conditions improved dramatically. There are tons of cameras and people around me right now — I can’t share much at the moment. We’ll talk in private.”\nOfir Braslavski, father of hostage Rom Braslavski, who was taken hostage from the Nova desert rave on October 7, 2023, and is still held in Gaza by Palestinian terrorists, joins a protest sit-in organized by the Shift 101 group, near the prime minister’s residence in Jerusalem.\n“Three weeks ago, a video of Rom was released, and he spoke about how a selekzia is made among the hostages, and why one is worth more and another less,” says Braslavski, referring to the Nazi process of separating family members during the Holocaust and deciding who would be murdered and who would be taken for forced labor.\n“We, the state, are to blame. For a year and seven months, he has been buried there; we failed to identify him. Until now, I avoided speaking about politics and the prime minister, but this is it — it’s a disgrace that they are still there. The prime minister now says he will negotiate under fire — I’ve stopped believing him,” he says of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n“I keep praying, and with God’s help, he will come back.”\nTwenty minutes later, sirens ring throughout central Israel and Jerusalem, warning of a ballistic missile fired by the Houthis from Yemen, and the Shift 101 participants keep sitting on the ground, some lying down, without cover from the rocket attack.\nYael and Adi Alexander, parents of released hostage Edan Alexander, give a statement to reporters at Tel Aviv’s Sourasky Hospital, a day after he was released home after 584 days in Hamas captivity.\nThey are surrounded by their other two children and other family members, all holding signs of other hostages still held in captivity.\nYael Alexander, speaking in Hebrew, and Adi Alexander, speaking in English, thank US President Donald Trump and his Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and hostage envoy Adam Boehler, for their work in bringing their son home.\n“President Trump, Steve Witkoff and Adam Boehler worked day and night to bring back my son,” says Yael Alexander.\n“We’ll never be able to express what that means to us, but we’ll never forget the tireless effort on Edan’s behalf; we are in their debt,” says Adi Alexander.\nYael Alexander thanks the Israeli public for supporting her and her family in their effort to bring Edan home. She does not thank the Israeli government, and they notably avoid thanking Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has argued that Israeli military pressure contributed to the release.\n“Most of the public believes that bringing back the hostages is the most important goal, a national and Jewish goal,” she says. “It’s not about right or left, but about the human heart.”\nShe calls on the Netanyahu government to heed that call.\n“I say that the return of Edan should be only the beginning of bringing back the rest of the hostages,” she says. “We have no time to wait. The time is running out and the world is watching us.”\nYael Alexander describes what her son has told them so far, about the terrible fears in captivity, the lack of water, the lack of food and aid, and the terror experienced when the IDF would strike Gaza, destroying buildings and bringing the fear of death to the captives.\n“The strikes and bombs made him think that every moment was about to be his last one,” she says.\n“Edan, my hero, you returned from the disaster. But other hostages are still living through that threat, they are still living in that hell. My heart has resumed beating, but they still need to return home.”\nAdi Alexander emphasizes in English what his wife says in Hebrew.\nHe mentions that his son, a dual American-Israeli citizen who was serving in the IDF as a lone soldier, will soon return home to the US, to New Jersey, to his life, family and friends.\n“This isn’t just about our family,” says Adi Alexander. “Tomorrow, a new set of negotiations will begin that could lead to more hostages coming home and eventually the end of this war.”\n“For me and my family, the effort to bring home all 58 hostages will continue until they’re all at home. Hopefully, these negotiations will lead to that moment.”\nPalestinian media reports another airstrike in the area of the European Hospital in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, some two hours after the wave of airstrikes that Israeli military sources say was meant to assassinate Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar.\nMeanwhile, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry raises the toll of the previous strikes to 16 killed and 70 injured.\nThe Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says six people have been killed and over 40 injured in the Israeli airstrike on the European Hospital in Khan Younis.\nA list of names of the people killed has been published, and it doesn’t contain Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar, who Israeli military sources say was the target of the strike. However, in the past, Hamas initially denied the deaths of its senior officials killed by Israel.\nUS President Donald Trump takes a shot at “neocons” and “interventionists” during his foreign policy speech in Riyadh.\n“It’s crucial for the wider world to know this great transformation [in the Middle East] has not come from Western interventionists, or flying people in beautiful planes giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs,” Trump says.\n“In the end, the so-called nation builders wrecked far more nations than they built and the interventionalists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,” he continues.\n“No, the gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called ‘nation builders,’ neocons, or liberal non-profits, like those who spent trillions and trillions of dollars failing to develop Baghdad and so many other cities,” Trump says.\n“Instead, the birth of a modern Middle East has been brought by the people of the region themselves — the people that are right here, the people [who] have lived here all their lives, developing your own sovereign countries, pursuing your own unique visions and charting your own destinies in your own way.”\n“You achieved a modern miracle the Arabian way,” he adds.\nUS President Donald Trump says he wants to strike a deal with Iran amid ongoing nuclear talks, but will cripple Iran’s economy if the Islamic Republic “rejects this olive branch.”\n“I want to make a deal with Iran. If I can make a deal with Iran, I’ll be very happy if we’re going to make your region and the world a safer place,” Trump says during a foreign policy speech in Riyadh.\n“But if Iran’s leadership rejects this olive branch and continues to attack their neighbors, then we will have no choice but to inflict massive maximum pressure [and] drive Iranian oil exports to zero like I did before,” he says.\n“Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. But with that said, Iran can have a much brighter future,” he adds.\n“This is an offer that will not last forever. The time is right now for them to choose… Things are happening at a very fast pace,” Trump says.\nHe calls Iran the “most destructive force” in the Middle East, and blames the regime for instability across the region.\nOffering what he describes as both a final warning and a potential opening for diplomacy, he says Iran has a choice between continuing its “chaos and terror” or embracing a path toward peace.\nUS President Donald Trump says his administration is working to release the remaining hostages and to end the war in Gaza.\n“We’ve been working tirelessly to bring back all hostages held by Hamas,” Trump says, highlighting yesterday’s release of American-Israeli Edan Alexander.\n“We continue to work to get that war ended as quickly as possible. It’s a horrible thing that’s taking place,” Trump says, again appearing to break with Israel, which has pushed back against calls to end the war, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power.\nTrump adds that “all civilized people must condemn the October 7 atrocities against Israel.”\n“The people of Gaza deserve a much better future, but that will or cannot occur as long as their leaders choose to kidnap, torture and target innocent men, women and children for political ends,” Trump says.\nIn a major development for the region, US President Donald Trump announces that he will be lifting Washington’s sanctions on Syria.\nHe says he made the decision after being pressed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, calling them people whom he has “a lot of respect for.”\n“I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” Trump announces during a speech at a Riyadh investment conference on the first day of his Midddle East trip.\nThe policy would appear to put him at odds with Israel, which has urged a much more cautious approach to the new Syrian government led by Ahmed al-Sharaa.\n“The sanctions were brutal and crippling and served a really important function at the time, but now it’s [the new Syrian government’s] time to shine,” Trump continues. “So I say, ‘Good luck Syria.'”\nHungary-based low-cost airline Wizz Air says it expects to resume flight services to and from Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport on May 15.\nOn May 5, Wizz Air halted all flights to Tel Aviv after a ballistic missile from Yemen struck an area of Israel’s main international airport.\nA ballistic missile launched at Israel by the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen was successfully intercepted by air defenses a short while ago, the military says.\nThere are no immediate reports of injuries or damage in the attack.\nSirens had sounded across central Israel and the Jerusalem area. Preceding the sirens by around a minute, an early warning was issued to residents, alerting civilians of the long-range missile attack via a push notification on their phones.\nSince March 18, when the IDF resumed its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis in Yemen have launched 31 ballistic missiles and at least 10 drones at Israel. Several of the missiles have fallen short.\nSirens are sounding across central Israel and the Jerusalem area following the launch of a ballistic missile from Yemen.\nThe IDF says it is working to shoot down the projectile.\nThe target of the Israeli airstrike at the European Hospital in southern Gaza a short while ago is Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar, defense sources say.\nThe IDF says it targeted Hamas operatives at an underground command center below the medical center in Khan Younis.\nPalestinian media reports four people killed, so far without mentioning Sinwar.\nSinwar, a senior Hamas military commander, is the younger brother of the former Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar.\nFollowing the killing of Hamas’s top military commander, Muhammed Deif, Muhammed Sinwar took charge of the terror group’s military wing. Later, after his older brother was killed by IDF troops, he became the de facto leader of the terror group in the Gaza Strip.\nIsraeli officials have described Muhammed Sinwar as stubborn with regards to negotiations with the terror group for the release of hostages.\nUS President Donald Trump says it’s his “dream” for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, but acknowledges that Riyadh will do it at its own time.\n“It’s my fervent hope, wish and even my dream that Saudi Arabia… will soon be joining the Abraham Accords,” Trump says in a foreign policy speech at an investment summit in Riyadh on the first day of his Middle East visit.\n“But you’ll do it in your own time,” Trump later adds in an apparent acknowledgement that Riyadh is not currently prepared to normalize relations with Israel, given the ongoing war in Gaza and the current government’s refusal to establish a pathway to a future Palestinian state.\nEducation Minister Yoav Kisch threatens to revoke funding for universities holding events to commemorate the Palestinian “Nakba,” or catastrophe, after student groups begin their annual demonstrations.\n“Academia is not a platform for incitement under the guise of freedom of expression,” Kisch writes in a post on X.\nHe says he has appealed to Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich to revoke funding for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv University following events that took place on their campuses with their support.\nSmotrich later says in a statement that he supports the move and will “instruct the professional authorities to immediately act on revoking the funding.”\nTension around marking the Nakba, which refers to the flight or displacement of an estimated 700,000 Palestinians around when Israel was created in 1948, are nothing new. Many Israelis view the commemorations as a veiled attempt to undermine the state’s existence.\nArab student groups at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem said yesterday that commemorating Nakba Day, traditionally marked on May 15, is even more essential this year “as the genocide against our people in Gaza continues.”\n“Let us raise our voices against this genocide and displacement,” a statement from the groups said, adding that they would pass the day reading letters and poems from people in the war-torn territory.\nBoth Tel Aviv University and the Hebrew University say in statements that they support their students’ rights to mark the day and call the minister’s threats illegal.\n“Tel Aviv University categorically rejects the education minister’s appalling threats to take illegal action and withhold funding from the university,” Tel Aviv University says in a statement, adding that under Israeli law, “demonstrations initiated by students on Nakba Day, which is held at most Israeli universities, are protected by the freedom of expression and protest.”\nThe Hebrew University responds similarly, saying that Kisch’s “directive is without any legal foundation or statutory support.”\n“The Hebrew University is committed to fostering coexistence across all sectors of Israeli society,” the statement says. “As part of its dedication to freedom of expression, the university ensures that diverse voices can be heard — embracing complexity in dialogue and encouraging mutual respect.”\nKisch responds on X that embracing such events “prevents academic freedom,” and that “any students who think that Nakba Day is a national day of mourning are invited to study at Birzeit University and not at the university of the first Zionist city in Israel.” Birzeit is a university in the West Bank.\nKisch says that under the law, institutions supporting Nakba Day activities should expect to have their budgets denied.\nThe IDF confirms launching strikes at the European Hospital in southern Gaza, saying it targeted Hamas operatives at an underground command center below the medical center.\nThe military says it took steps to mitigate civilian harm in the strike, including by using precision munitions, aerial surveillance, and other intelligence.\n“The Hamas terror organization continues to use hospitals in the Gaza Strip for terror purposes, cynically and cruelly exploiting the civilian population in and around the hospital,” the military adds.\n#شاهد| الاحتلال يشن حزامًا ناريًا بالقرب من مستشفى الأوروبي شرق مدينة خانيونس pic.twitter.com/1gqgBcqVTm\n— وكالة شهاب للأنباء (@ShehabAgency) May 13, 2025\n#عاجل استهداف المستشفى الأوروبي جنوب خان يونس بحرام ناري pic.twitter.com/vCHHtNFlB5\n— Khaled Safi ???????? خالد صافي (@KhaledSafi) May 13, 2025\nPalestinian media reports a large wave of airstrikes near the European Hospital in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis.\nSeveral casualties are reported in the strikes.\n#شاهد| الاحتلال يشن حزامًا ناريًا بالقرب من مستشفى الأوروبي شرق مدينة خانيونس pic.twitter.com/1gqgBcqVTm\n— وكالة شهاب للأنباء (@ShehabAgency) May 13, 2025\nUS President Donald Trump has agreed to say hello to Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia tomorrow, a White House official says.\nThe comment comes shortly after Trump himself indicated that he will meet with Sharaa. Leaving the King Abdul Aziz International Conference Center, he stopped to a shouted question from a reporter, who asked if he was meeting the Syrian president.\nNodding, Trump said, “I think so,” before entering a limousine.\nAccording to the London Times, citing unnamed security sources, Sharaa may use the meeting to offer talks on normalizing relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords.\nA day after his release from captivity in Gaza, Edan Alexander posts his first Instagram Story.\n“Home sweet home,” he writes alongside a photo of him wearing sunglasses and holding a beer bottle.\nCalling the enlistment of yeshiva students “an essential security need,” Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara urges the IDF to begin sending conscription orders to all draft-age ultra-Orthodox men at the start of the next recruitment cycle in July.\nThe High Court’s provisional order from April demanding to know why the government has failed to enforce enlistment orders constitutes a “red flag,” the Attorney General’s Office declares, arguing that the current scope of Haredi recruitment is “far from meeting the needs of the army.”\nIn a document summarizing a recent meeting with senior military and civilian officials, the Attorney General’s Office insists that as long as a new law regulating the status of yeshiva students is not enacted, “from a legal perspective, the state is legally obligated to act according to existing law, and to implement the general conscription obligation in an equal and uniform manner in relation to the entire population.”\nAs such, Baharav-Miara welcomes IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir’s recent instructions to the IDF Personnel Directorate “to significantly increase the scope of conscription orders for members of the ultra-Orthodox public and to increase enforcement against evaders generally.”\nOut of 18,915 Haredim who received initial draft orders since July 2024, around 319 have enlisted, while 2,521 who have ignored multiple draft orders have been sent immediate call-up orders requiring them to show up at an induction center within 48 hours or be declared a draft evader.\nOf these, 964 have been declared draft evaders, a number expected to rise significantly in the coming weeks, the Attorney General’s Office states.\nThe consequences of being declared a draft evader include receiving a “no exit order” — being barred from leaving the country. In addition, during any encounter with the police, the draft dodger can be arrested.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron expresses “relief” following the return of former hostage Edan Alexander to Israel yesterday, and says that with US President Donald Trump’s Middle East visit, he is hoping for a ceasefire to be reached in Gaza.\n“Relief after the release of Edan Alexander. Every life returned to freedom is a victory and a step toward peace,” the French leader writes on X.\n“We do not forget the hostages still held by Hamas — they must be released without delay,” he says.\n“I am counting on [Trump] and his crucial visit to the region. Full support for a ceasefire in Gaza!” Macron adds.\nThe United States and Saudi Arabia have discussed Riyadh’s potential purchase of Lockheed’s F-35 jets, two sources briefed on discussions tell Reuters, referring to a military aircraft that the kingdom has reportedly been interested in for years.\nHowever, it is not clear if Washington would permit the kingdom to move forward with a purchase that would give Saudi Arabia an advanced weapon used by close US ally Israel, one of the sources says.\n“[Qualitative Military Edge] with Israel has come up,” the second source says, referring to US guarantees that Israel receives more advanced American weapons than Arab states.\nThe sources spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.\nIsrael has owned F-35s for nine years, building multiple squadrons.\nGovernments in the Gulf have long sought the most advanced fighter jet, built with stealth technology allowing it to evade enemy detection. If the US is to approve the transfer, Saudi Arabia would be only the second Middle East state after Israel to operate F-35 fighters.\nUS President Donald Trump signs a strategic economic agreement with Saudi Arabia as the oil power rolls out the red carpet for him at the start of a tour of Gulf states aimed at drumming up trillions of dollars in investments.\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman signs an agreement with the US president, which Saudi state television says covers energy, defense, mining and other areas.\nThe White House says Saudi Arabia is set to invest $600 billion in the United States, including a mammoth arms deal described as the largest “in history” between the allies, worth nearly $142 billion.\n“I really believe we like each other a lot,” Trump says during a meeting in Riyadh with the crown prince, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler.\nTrump, who is accompanied by a host of US business leaders, including billionaire Elon Musk, will go on from Riyadh to Qatar tomorrow and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.\nHe has not scheduled a stop in Israel, a decision that has raised questions about where the close ally stands in Washington’s priorities, and the focus of the trip is on investment rather than security matters in the Middle East.\nThe Trump administration’s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism says the US government is cutting $450 million in grants to Harvard University, in addition to the $2.2 billion the government has already withdrawn.\n“Harvard University has repeatedly failed to confront the pervasive race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment plaguing its campus,” says a joint statement from the US Department of Education, the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the General Services Administration.\nThe statement cites recent reporting that said the Harvard Law Review considered race as a factor in its article application process, and awarded a $65,000 fellowship to a protester who allegedly assaulted a Jewish student. The story was first reported by The Washington Free Beacon.\n“Harvard’s campus, once a symbol of academic prestige, has become a breeding ground for virtue signaling and discrimination. This is not leadership; it is cowardice,” the statement says.\nPalestinian media reports that within the span of a few hours, Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces have shot and killed two Palestinians in the northern West Bank.\nOne incident occurred in the Far’a refugee camp near Tubas, and the other in the city of Jenin. In both cases, the individuals were shot while inside their vehicles.\nRegarding the first incident, PA security forces spokesperson Anwar Rajab states that a PA force returned fire after being shot at during an arrest operation in the Tubas area. He adds that the slain man was “one of the symbols of the security chaos in the area.”\nIn the second incident in Jenin, a video circulates showing an elderly man shot dead in his car, but the PA security forces have not yet issued an official response.\nIt is rare for PA security forces to shoot and kill Palestinians. About six months ago, they launched an unusual operation in the Jenin refugee camp aimed at combating terror operatives involved in attacks. That operation ended after about two months, following the launch of a large-scale IDF operation in the camp.\nThe IDF confirms carrying out two drone strikes in southern Lebanon today, targeting Hezbollah operatives.\nAccording to the IDF, one of the Hezbollah members was operating at a site belonging to the terror group near  Beaufort Castle, a site that was targeted in a major airstrike last week.\nThe IDF says the restoration of the site and activity there by Hezbollah “constitute a blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon.”\nThe second Hezbollah operative was targeted near the southern Lebanese town of Houla, the army adds.\nכלי טיס תקף היום מחבל מארגון הטרור חיזבאללה, במרחב רכס הבופור שבדרום לבנון.\nהמחבל פעל באתר שצה״ל תקף בשבוע שעבר, וממנו נוהל מערך האש וההגנה של חיזבאללה.\nשיקום האתר והפעילות בו מהווים הפרה בוטה של ההבנות בין ישראל ללבנון.\nבנוסף, תקף כלי טיס מחבל חיזבאללה נוסף, במרחב חולא… pic.twitter.com/fE5WmKOBpA\n— צבא ההגנה לישראל (@idfonline) May 13, 2025\nUS President Donald Trump appears to confirm that he will meet with interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa during his swing through Saudi Arabia.\nLeaving the King Abdul Aziz International Conference Center, Trump stops for a moment before getting into his limousine to answer a shouted question from a reporter, who asks if he is meeting the Syrian president.\nNodding, Trump says, “I think so,” before climbing in the vehicle.\nAccording to the London Times, citing unnamed security sources, Sharaa may use the meeting to offer talks on normalizing relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords.\nSyrian activists and Gulf Arab states have been trying to arrange a landmark meeting between the two leaders this week on the sidelines of Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\nSharaa spoke with Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Sunday, according to the Syrian presidency.\nPresident Isaac Herzog plans to attend Pope Leo XIV’s inauguration, his spokesperson confirms to The Times of Israel. The ceremony is set to take place in Rome on May 18.\nAt Pope Francis’s funeral last month, Israel was represented only by its Ambassador to the Holy See Yaron Sideman, a choice seen by many as a sign of the tensions between Jerusalem and the Vatican in the shadow of the latter’s criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza during the war sparked by Hamas’s October 7, 2023, onslaught.\nYemen’s Sanaa International Airport will resume operations starting tomorrow, the airport’s general director says.\nOperations have been suspended since May 7 due to damage from an Israeli strike as the Iran-backed Houthis, who control Sanaa, continue to launch ballistic missiles toward the Jewish state.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a meeting with wounded IDF reservists last night that Israel may agree to a short-term ceasefire for the release of hostages, but will not end the war under any circumstances until Hamas is defeated, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.\n“The situation has changed. In the coming days, we will go in [to Gaza] with full force to complete the operation. Completing the operation means subduing Hamas. It means destroying Hamas,” the premier tells the reservists, in a video shared by the PMO.\n“Eliminating Hamas and freeing all our hostages — these go hand in hand. That’s how we’re doing this,” continues Netanyahu.\nAs Israel sends a delegation to Doha for final efforts at reaching a ceasefire-hostage deal before US President Donald Trump concludes his Middle East visit, Netanyahu says: “Maybe Hamas will say, ‘Wait — we want to release 10 more [hostages].’ Fine, bring them. We’ll take them. And then we’ll go in. But there will be no situation where we stop the war.”\n“A temporary ceasefire — fine. But we’re going all the way,” the premier says.\n“We’ve already set up a governing body that will allow [civilians] to exit, but the main issue is this — we need host countries willing to absorb them. That’s what we’re working on right now,” he adds.\n“If we give them a way out, I’m telling you — more than 50% will leave. In my opinion, many more. But Hamas will not remain there,” he says.\nThe reservists, who are members of the “Wounded Soldiers for Victory” forum, “expressed support for Netanyahu’s leadership in pursuing victory and achieving all the war’s objectives, and urged him to decisively defeat the terrorist organization Hamas,” the PMO says.\n“You are an example and an inspiration, and with your spirit, we are heading toward total victory,” he tells the group.\nJust after arriving back in Israel from a state visit to Germany, President Isaac Herzog calls released hostage Edan Alexander to welcome him home.\n“Welcome home, beloved son of the State of Israel,” Herzog tells him in a phone call from his car on the way home from the airport. “We’re so excited — it’s not just in Tenafly, everyone is excited, every house in Israel is excited.”\nAlexander tries to thank the president, who replies: “Listen, we’re saying thank you to you, you were there for so long.” The freed captive adds: “I can’t believe how all this happened.”\nYesterday, Herzog watched Alexander’s release during his meeting in Berlin with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.\nThe United States, in coordination with Qatar, agreed to push Israel to accept a months-long ceasefire and hostage exchange deal in return for the release of American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, Axios reports.\nDuring Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman al-Thani’s visit to the White House last month, the Gulf state leader met with US President Donald Trump and US special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, and suggested that they support a Hamas-approved proposal for a deal to release all hostages and end the war, but Washington said a temporary, phased deal was the only viable option, according to the outlet.\nUpon returning to Doha, al-Thani encouraged Hamas to make a gesture to Trump in order to change the president’s position, shortly after which Hamas reached out to Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian-American businessman and Trump supporter, to mediate talks with the US on the proposal, officials said in the report. The existence of this backchannel was first reported by The Times of Israel.\nThe White House subsequently told the terror group that if Alexander were released, the US would pressure Israel to implement a 70- to 90-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of 10 hostages, during which negotiations for a final deal would be held, according to a Palestinian official quoted in the report.\nThe US, Qatar and Egypt would ensure that the war wouldn’t resume throughout the talks, the official adds, though the US did not confirm this to Axios.\nAl-Thani played a critical role in persuading Hamas to agree to a deal, while Netanyahu was highly involved and the IDF’s campaign in Gaza was “instrumental,” a senior US official says.\nFor his part, Trump did not pressure Netanyahu during their phone call yesterday to roll back his plans for an expanded ground campaign in Gaza set to begin after Trump’s Middle East visit, Israeli officials tell Axios.\nAxios echoes other reports that Witkoff and US hostage envoy Adam Boehler will be traveling to Doha with Israeli negotiators today, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to a request from the Trump administration to send a negotiating team to jumpstart the stalled hostage-ceasefire talks with Hamas.\nNetanyahu has stressed that negotiations would be conducted with Gaza “under fire” and that the military’s planned offensive to achieve control of the entire Strip will still go ahead if Hamas does not release more captives first.\nIran is open to accepting temporary limits on its uranium enrichment, its deputy foreign minister says, adding that talks with the United States have yet to address such specifics.\n“For a limited period of time, we can accept a series of restrictions on the level and volume of enrichment,” Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi says.\n“We have not yet gone into details about the level and volume of enrichment,” he adds in quotes carried by the Tasnim news agency.\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said at the latest round of nuclear talks that the right to enrich uranium was “nonnegotiable,” while US chief negotiator Steve Witkoff called it a “red line.”\nIsrael has demanded that any agreement prohibit any enrichment, though the US has at times indicated it could agree to a deal that caps enrichment.\nA delegation of relatives of hostages are heading to Qatar to meet with US President Donald Trump and Qatari premier Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman al-Thani, Channel 12 news reports.\nThe channel describes the delegation as “small.” The exact makeup of the reported delegation is not specified.\nAccording to the channel, the group is being led by Eytan Stibbe, a former fighter pilot, arms dealer and businessman who was part of a private trip to space in 2022.\nTrump is expected in Doha on Wednesday, while an Israeli team is expected to fly there today for talks on a hostage deal and ceasefire in Gaza. US envoys Steve Witkoff and Adam Boehler told hostages’ families they would also travel to Doha for the talks.\nThe Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee approves the government’s emergency call-up of tens of thousands of additional reservists, a day after the measure failed to muster enough support in the same committee.\nThe approval is good for one week, with another vote scheduled next week.\nYesterday’s vote was deadlocked 2-2, forcing the coalition to call for ultra-Orthodox members of the committee — who oppose sending their own children to the army — to enlist in the effort to approve the call-up.\nFollowing the vote, Yesh Atid MK Yorai Lahav Hertzanu of the opposition complains on social media that the measure passed because a member of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party voted in favor, even as his party is threatening to bring down the coalition over the IDF’s decision to enforce enlistment orders.\nCapping off his state visit to Berlin, President Isaac Herzog arrives back in Israel, welcoming his German counterpart for a reciprocal visit.\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier touches down in Israel about half an hour after Herzog’s return, and is welcomed at the airport in a brief ceremony.\nThe two leaders will head straight to the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem, and later this evening Steinmeier will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Herzog.\nTomorrow, they will tour Kibbutz Be’eri, which was devastated by Hamas’s October 7 attack, and will present plans to rebuild a new art gallery there. They will also plant a tree together.\nSteinmeier’s visit comes after Herzog’s whirlwind one-day trip to Berlin yesterday to mark 60 years of diplomatic ties with Germany, including a meeting with the newly sworn in Chancellor Friedrich Merz.\nForeign Minister Gideon Sa’ar calls on the international community to support what he describes as “an American initiative” to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, during opening remarks at a Tokyo meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, Sa’ar’s office says in a statement.\n“Israel supports the American initiative to allocate humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza and not to Hamas. We call on the international community to support it,” says Sa’ar.\nOn Sunday, Sa’ar announced in a joint press conference with his German counterpart that Israel “fully endorses” what he called an American plan for providing aid to the Gaza Strip, though officials familiar with the mechanism have told The Times of Israel that the Israeli government and military have been heavily involved in putting the scheme together.\n“We hope our objectives are achieved and that this war ends soon. We want to return to the path of expanding the circle of peace and normalization in the Middle East,” says Sa’ar in Japan, where he arrived this morning for the first official visit to the G7 country by an Israeli foreign minister since 2010.\n“Hamas started this war on October 7 and is responsible for its continuation by refusing to release our hostages and refusing to disarm…The October 7 attack caused a regional war. And this fundamental thing must be changed,” says Sa’ar, adding that, “with a terrorist state like Hamas — we will not be able to ensure regional stability.”\n“We are truly grateful for Japan’s steadfast support for Israel after Hamas’s horrific attack on October 7. You clearly condemned Hamas and recognized Israel’s right to self-defense,” Sa’ar tells Iwaya, adding that Japan was swift to impose sanctions on three Hamas leaders and call for the immediate release of the hostages in Gaza.\n“This visit is a special opportunity to strengthen our bilateral relations. We would like to do it in economy, defense, innovation, science, technology and people to people,” continues the foreign minister.\nSa’ar thanks his counterpart for his hospitality and invites him to visit Israel soon.\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff and US hostage envoy Adam Boehler told the families of hostages still in Gaza that they think there is a chance to make progress on freeing their loved ones as they head to Qatar for indirect talks between Israel and Hamas, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum says.\nWitkoff “assured the families that if he and Boehler didn’t believe there was a genuine chance for progress in negotiations, they wouldn’t be making the trip to Doha,” the Forum says, noting that the meeting lasted nearly two hours.\n“Both officials emphasized their personal commitment to bringing back all 58 remaining hostages – both the living and the deceased,” the statement says. “Witkoff emphasized that they will accept nothing less than the return of everyone, as this is the President’s mission.\nWitkoff also told the families that “everyone would prefer to see a diplomatic solution,” the Forum says.\nIn an official statement, the IDF says it has launched a “routine” Military Police campaign to detain those who ignored enlistment orders following the latest round of call-ups.\n“Last night, there was an [arrest] operation close to the draft period as has been carried out previously, in an equal manner across all sects of society and against anyone who did not show up as required,” the IDF says.\nThe comment comes after a report that the army would launch large-scale arrest raids tomorrow targeting Haredi draft dodgers, which ignited a firestorm of protest among ultra-Orthodox politicians.\nThe army says the campaign last night was aimed at a total of 36 people evading conscription, and not just ultra-Orthodox men. The IDF first made contact with those not showing up at induction centers, in an attempt to sort the matter out voluntarily, and would only afterward carry out arrests.\nIt is unclear how many arrests actually took place.\nThe detainees will either face disciplinary measures or a criminal trial, depending on how long they have ignored draft orders.\nIn general, the Military Police’s arrest campaigns are aimed at those who have ignored draft orders recently, and therefore will only face disciplinary measures.\nIt marks the third arrest campaign against draft dodgers since the beginning of the war, with the previous ones taking place in November 2024 and March 2025, according to the army.\nThe Military Police have been occupied with war-related tasks, therefore only three such operations have been carried out.\nThe military notes that last week, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir instructed the Personnel Directorate to bring forward an immediate plan to “expand and maximize” the sending out of draft orders to members of the ultra-Orthodox community\n“The plan is currently being prepared,” the IDF says.\nLebanese media report on an alleged Israeli drone strike on a motorcycle in southern Lebanon’s Houla.\nThere is no immediate comment from the IDF.\nتصحيح | مراسل #الجديد: الغارة الإسرائيلية في حولا إستهدفت دراجة نارية @farhat_muhamad1 pic.twitter.com/MHmmEKi6Eb\n— Al Jadeed News (@ALJADEEDNEWS) May 13, 2025\nIn a call with Edan Alexander and Steve Witkoff, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hails the captive’s return and praises IDF readiness if no Hamas deal is reached.\nFreed hostage Edan Alexander said he is weak but slowly recovering, in the phone call with Netanyahu earlier in the day, in a video of the call shared by the premier’s office.\n“Craziness, craziness, it’s unbelievable,” Alexander says at the top of the call. Asked how he is feeling, the soldier replies haltingly, “I’m okay. Weak, but little by little, I’ll get back to what was before. It’s all a matter of time.”\nNetanyahu praises Israel’s medical teams for helping the ex-captive recover, and tells him, “You really sound like you’re on the right track,” ordering the 21-year-old to listen to their medical advice.\nThe premier also says Israel is “rejoiced” following his return and that the country is ready to fight Hamas if no wider hostage deal is reached.\nUS President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff also participated in the call held during the envoy’s visit to the hospital where the dual national is recovering this morning.\n“You have one brave Israeli soldier there — who is also a champion of America and Israel together, and we’re very very happy and very grateful to the help you and President Trump gave us,” Netanyahu tells Witkoff in English.\n“And we of course value his [Alexander’s] comrades, the Israeli soldiers who are ready to take whatever action if our other friends, our other hostages, are not released, so it’s a great moment,” continues the premier.\nWitkoff responds by saying, “Mr. Prime Minister, I told Edan and his family everything you have done to make this possible over the last several days. It was a tense negotiation, and it was critical how you were, how you allowed the negotiations to operate, and that’s in large part the reason that Edan is home with his family today.”\nMalnutrition rates are rising in Gaza and hunger could have lasting impacts on “an entire generation,” the World Health Organization’s representative for the Palestinian Territories says.\nRik Peeperkorn said he had seen children in clinics who looked years younger than their age.\n“Without enough nutritious food, clean water and access to health care, an entire generation will be permanently affected,” Peeperkorn tells a press briefing by video link from Deir al-Balah inside the Strip, warning of poor health, stunting and impaired cognitive development.\nHamas is rejecting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s claim that military pressure helped secure the release of US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander.\n“The return of Edan Alexander is the result of serious communications with the US administration and the efforts of mediators, not a consequence of Israeli aggression or the illusion of military pressure,” the Palestinian terror group says in a statement.\n“Netanyahu is misleading his people and has failed to bring back his prisoners through aggression,” Hamas adds.\n“The return of Edan Alexander confirms that serious negotiations and a prisoner exchange deal are the way to bring back the prisoners and end the war,” the Hamas statement adds.\nUS President Donald Trump’s special envoy on hostages, Adam Boehler, tells a group of Israeli reporters in Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square that following the release of American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, there is a “better chance” to reach a deal with Hamas that sees the remaining 58 hostages in Gaza go free.\n“I think there’s a better chance now than before,” Boehler says when asked about the likelihood of a larger deal.\n“I think Hamas knows that they can pull a deal any day that they want. They need to approach Trump, they need to approach [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu], and they need to set this up the right way,” the envoy adds.\nAsked what Israel will decide to do about the war in Gaza after Trump’s visit to the region this week, Boehler replies, “I think that that is up to Israel and they’ll consult with the president, I can’t say.”\n“Here’s the one thing I will say: this is a moment for Israelis. It’s extremely important for Edan Alexander to be put forward, to be released, and I think there is hope of change now,” he says.\nThe Israeli Navy detained an unarmed suspect who swam from Egypt into Israeli territory near the southernmost city of Eilat a short while ago, the military says.\nThe suspect was handed over to police for further questioning.\nOpposition Leader Yair Lapid and other opposition figures express approval of the upcoming military operation to arrest draft dodgers.\n“The military police are not ‘arresting Haredim,’ they are arresting young Israelis who received a draft order during the war and did not show up at the military induction base to enlist in the defense of the state,” Lapid tweets.\nThe Democrats chairman Yair Golan tweets, “The law is the law. Recruitment is recruitment and equality is equality. Don’t stop, recruit everyone.”\nIn the wake of the latest coalition crisis, in which the Haredi parties threatened to bring down the coalition if even one yeshiva student is arrested, a Likud source tells the Maariv daily that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will pass an enlistment bill no matter what, even if he has to replace Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee chairman Yuli Edelstein.\nSpeaking to the parents of slain American-Israeli hostage Itay Chen at Hostages’ Square, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff says the release of Edan Alexander was a “stepping stone,” while appearing to praise the efforts of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure the release of those in Gaza.\n“Everyone is still focused on dialogue, diplomacy and bringing them home,” Witkoff says in a Reuters video showing them speaking on a crowded sidewalk.\nMiddle East envoy Steve Witkoff visits Hostages Square in Tel Aviv https://t.co/37dKSwluKv\n— Reuters (@Reuters) May 13, 2025\nIn answer to an inaudible comment from Hagit Chen, Witkoff replies, “But he did a lot. Without his help, it didn’t happen,” presumably referring to Netanyahu and yesterday’s release of Edan Alexander.\n“The prime minister was strong. He was totally strong for the deal, Ron Dermer was for the deal,” he says.\n“I’m telling you, the pressure Bibi put on after the second phase achieved [inaudible], that’s a fact,” he adds.\nMilitary officials tell reporters that the upcoming arrest campaign against suspects who ignored enlistment orders is a routine operation that takes place several times a year, after each drafting period.\nThe officials say that the Military Police will work to detain draft dodgers from all parts of society, and not just ultra-Orthodox men.\nThe clarification comes after the news that they would launch the raid sparked a political firestorm, with ultra-Orthodox politicians threatening to bring down the government over the move.\nUS President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff says he wants the release of American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander to be a “beacon of hope” for the hostage families, as he makes his way through Hostages Square in Tel Aviv.\nAfter visiting Alexander at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center this morning, Witkoff is asked by Israeli journalist Amichai Stein what message he has for the families of the remaining 58 hostages in Gaza today. “I hope this is a beacon of hope for everybody else,” he says.\nPresident Trump envoy tells me: the release of Edan Alexander is a beacon of Hope pic.twitter.com/qGuIldwQto\n— Amichai Stein (@AmichaiStein1) May 13, 2025\nThe envoy also praises Trump, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani for their help in the release process, despite Israel apparently being bypassed in the negotiations that led to Alexander being set free.\n“Thank God for President Trump. And, by the way, the prime minister [Netanyahu] did an exceptional job here, as did the Qatari PM,” says Witkoff before walking through a scrum of journalists, well-wishers and security guards.\nHe tells reporters his meeting with Alexander in the hospital was “inspirational for all of us.”\nNoting that Alexander spoke by phone with Netanyahu, Witkoff says “the prime minister was incredible in this effort” to secure Alexander’s release. “It wouldn’t have happened without him.”\nAlexander also spoke to Trump, and “it was Donald Trump who guided this,” Witkoff says.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is working “day and night” to return all hostages remaining in Gaza, after the brother of a soldier who went missing 43 years ago and was brought back to Israel this week thanked him for not giving up.\n“I was deeply moved to hear the words of Itzik Feldman at the funeral of his brother,” writes Netanyahu on X.\nOn Sunday, Israel announced that it had recovered the remains of Sgt. First Class Zvi Feldman, who went missing along with two other troops during the battle of Sultan Yacoub during the First Lebanon War in 1982.\nהתרגשתי עד עומק הלב לשמוע את דבריו של איציק פלדמן בהלוויה של אחיו, סמ”ר צבי פלדמן ז”ל, שנפל בלבנון.\nהמילים שלו ביטאו כאב גדול – אבל גם תקווה ואמונה.\nאנחנו לא עוצרים לרגע. פועלים יומם וליל כדי להחזיר את כל הבנים והבנות שלנו – את כל חטופינו. pic.twitter.com/IMfpmSOzbY\n— Benjamin Netanyahu – בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) May 13, 2025\nA video attached to the prime minister’s post shows Feldman speaking at his brother’s funeral yesterday, recalling a protest families held some 30 years ago demanding the return of Feldman and other presumed captives. Netanyahu spoke to the families and promised to bring them home, he says.\n“His words expressed immense pain — but also hope and faith. We’re not stopping for a moment. We’re working day and night to bring back all our sons and daughters — all our hostages,” says the premier.\nSenior ultra-Orthodox political officials have informed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the launch of a large-scale enforcement operation against Haredi draft dodgers could bring about the Haredi parties’ “immediate resignation from the government,” public broadcaster Kan reports.\nSpeaking with the Ynet news site, an unnamed senior Haredi party official says that “if dozens and hundreds of yeshiva students are indeed arrested, as we currently seeing, these will be the government’s last days.”\nBoth the Shas and UTJ parties would need to leave to bring down Netanyahu’s coalition.\nMilitary Police are set to begin a large-scale arrest operation tomorrow against ultra-Orthodox men who ignored enlistment orders, Channel 13 news reports.\nThe network reports that dozens of Israel Defense Forces draft evaders are expected to be arrested in the operation.\nThe IDF in the coming weeks will complete sending out draft orders to 24,000 Haredi men, wrapping up an effort that began last summer but has seen only a handful enlist.\nEarlier this week, a military official acknowledged that in practice, the IDF had not been enforcing the draft orders it was sending out to the ultra-Orthodox, who have traditionally been granted exemptions from military service. Haredi politicians are attempting to legislate new rules aimed at reinstating those exemptions after courts found them to be unconstitutional.\n“We don’t enforce the draft orders for the ultra-Orthodox enough,” the official said. “There is almost no enforcement of them.”\nPrevious attempts to enforce draft orders have been met with large-scale protests from the community, including demonstrations that have turned violent.\nSpecial US envoy Steve Witkoff and freed American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander spoke to US President Donald Trump over the phone from Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center this morning, the envoy says.\nWitkoff and Alexander “had the opportunity to speak with [US President Donald Trump], whose leadership made this possible. We remain committed to bringing every last hostage home,” says the envoy in a post from his office on X.\nI was honored to meet Edan Alexander today and welcome him home.

The Prime Minister’s Office has not immediately responded to a request for confirmation on this detail.\nUS President Donald Trump begins his Mideast tour with a rare tarmac welcome from Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who warmly greets Trump as he steps off Air Force One.\nThe pomp began before Trump even landed. Royal Saudi Air Force F-15s provided an honorary escort for Air Force One as it approached the kingdom’s capital.\nThe two leaders retreat to a grand hall at the Riyadh airport, where Trump and his aides are served traditional Arabic coffee by waiting attendants wearing ceremonial gun-belts.\nThe crown prince’s airport greeting underscores the close relationship the de facto ruler of the kingdom wants to have with the American leader.\nTypically, a provincial governor or another official will greet a foreign leader on arrival. King Salman once greeted US president Barack Obama at the airport on a trip to the kingdom, but then lower-ranking officials did as the kingdom grew angry over his stance on the 2011 Arab Spring and the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers.\nUS president Joe Biden also was greeted by a provincial governor on his 2022 trip to the kingdom, before having an awkward fist-bump with Prince Mohammed, whom he had derided as a “pariah” during his election campaign after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\nRegional Cooperation Minister David Amsalem lashes out at Donald Trump, saying he expects more in the way of cooperation from the US president.\n“Trump until now has acted in Israel’s interest, but it turns out that this guy is unpredictable,” he tells Kan radio of the famously mercurial president. “Every day he is on a different side.”\nPraising former US president Joe Biden as someone “who really loved Israel,” Amsalem says Trump can’t be relied upon, specifically mentioning his agreement to stop attacking Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels.\n“We are dealing with a president that gets up in the morning with A, at night decides B and afterward C and does D,” says the Likud minister, who is considered a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “It confuses the whole world on every subject. When you are leading the world, there is a way of doing things, there is a method, consistency.”\nHe describes the lack of coordination between Washington and Jerusalem on regional issues, including negotiating the release of hostage Edan Alexander, as “a serious thing. It’s breaking every norm there ever was between Israel and the US.”\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is speaking by phone with freed American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, the Prime Minister’s Office says.\nAlexander was released yesterday from Hamas captivity after the US Trump administration bilaterally negotiated his release, and is now hospitalized at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff is currently visiting the dual national at the hospital, according to Hebrew media reports. There is no immediate confirmation from US officials.\nThe Hostage and Missing Families Forum confirms that newly freed hostage Edan Alexander will not meet US President Donald Trump in Qatar.\n“The Alexander family confirms that as of now, Edan will not fly to Qatar,” a statement reads. “The family remains in continuous contact with the Trump administration.”\nAccording to Channel 12 news, Alexander is expected to spend at least four days in the hospital, by which time Trump will have departed the region.\nAir Force One, carrying US President Donald Trump, has landed in Riyadh, kicking off a four-day regional tour by the president, who is making his first major foreign trip since reentering office in January.\nA purple set of stairs leads from the plane to a purple carpet on the tarmac lined by Saudi officials and a royal honor guard, who await the president’s appearance under the sweltering Saudi sun.\nThe family of Edan Alexander says the newly freed former hostage will not travel to Qatar to meet US President Donald Trump, but will eventually visit the president in the US.\n“His medical condition requires that he rest,” the family says in a statement carried by Channel 12 news. “He will meet with Trump in the US at a later date.”\nThe channel reports that Alexander will speak with Trump by phone later in the day, according to the family.\nReports yesterday indicated that plans were in the works to have Alexander, a dual Israeli-American citizen, fly to Qatar at the request of Trump, where he would personally thank the president and the Qatari emir for moves that saw Hamas free him from captivity as an apparent goodwill gesture.\nTrump, whose plane is about to land in Saudi Arabia, is expected in Qatar on Wednesday.\nA British activist is facing deportation from Israel over social media posts criticizing Israeli cops and soldiers and supporting an organization urging a boycott against the country, police say.\nThe 35-year-old woman, who is not named, was arrested Monday after entering a closed military zone in the West Bank’s South Hebron Hills, according to authorities, who accuse her of refusing orders to identify herself and threatening a settlement security coordinator who arrived on the scene.\n“During questioning, it was discovered that the suspect had uploaded social media posts against police and IDF soldiers, and was part of an organization calling to boycott the State of Israel,” police say in a statement. “In the wake of what arose during the investigation, [the Population and Immigration Authority] decided to deport her.”\nThe woman is being held in jail pending her departure, police add.\nForeign Minister Gideon Sa’ar has arrived in Japan for the first official visit to the G7 country by an Israeli foreign minister in 15 years, the Foreign Ministry announces.\nDuring his three-day visit, Sa’ar will meet with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, members of the Japan-Israel Parliamentary friendship group, and other top Japanese officials, the ministry says in a statement.\nIn October, Iwaya “unequivocally condemned” the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel but said he was “gravely concerned” by the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip one year into the ongoing conflict.\nWhile in Japan, Sa’ar will give interviews to local media and hold a press conference aimed at “strengthening Israel’s narrative in the Japanese press,” Sa’ar’s office says.\nThe foreign minister is expected to return to Israel on Thursday.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to Tokyo on May 12, 2014, marking the last major diplomatic visit to Japan by an Israeli official.\nAmerican and Saudi flags are lining the streets in Saudi Arabia’s capital ahead of US President Donald Trump’s arrival, along with a noticeable security presence in Riyadh of all American-made police cars.\nAt a “Media Oasis” set up for journalists, giant video screens show off Saudi construction projects like its futuristic NEOM city and its hosting of the 2034 FIFA World Cup.

Abbas writes in the English-language Arab News newspaper that “the significance of the visit cannot be overstated — nor could its timing be more crucial,” given Saudi Arabia’s mediation in the Russia-Ukraine war and the recent conflict between India and Pakistan.\nHe also acknowledges business deals that will be a centerpiece of the trip.\n“Putting America first does not mean ignoring opportunities abroad; it means seizing them,” Abbas writes.\nPrince Turki al-Faisal, who led Saudi intelligence for more than two decades and served as ambassador to the US and Britain, addresses Trump in the same paper, writing that “our doors and hearts are open to you.”\nUS President Donald Trump ordered an end to a military campaign against Yemen’s Houthis after being frustrated by a lack of progress against the Iran-backed group and the mounting costs of the campaign, the New York Times reports.\nThe Trump administration has portrayed the ceasefire, which included no guarantees regarding continued attacks against Israel or other non-US assets, as a victory, claiming the Houthis sued for peace after being degraded by two months of intense strikes.\nBut according to the report, Trump had sought an off-ramp from the campaign after the Houthis continued to successfully resist US forces, who lost a number of Reaper drones and two F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets, giving the Pentagon 30 days to show results rather than pressing ahead with the original proposed plan for an eight- to 10-month engagement aimed at disabling the group. The paper, relying on unnamed former and current officials, reports that the campaign cost the US over $1 billion in its first month alone, and sparked fears that the US would be short munitions it could need to defend Taiwan against China, leading Trump to seek a way out.\nThe initial proposal had called for air strikes to take out Houthi air defenses followed by a campaign of assassinations, largely modeled on Israel’s successful war against Hezbollah. Trump had only partially approved the plan, the paper reports.\nThe idea for a truce was advanced by the Omanis via US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff as they brokered nuclear talks between Washington and Tehran, according to the Times.\nIsrael was caught off guard by the US agreement to stop bombing the Houthis, which was announced days after a missile hit Ben Gurion airport, injuring several people and sparking heavy Israeli strikes on Houthi infrastructure, including Sana’a’s main airport. The Houthis have since continued to fire missiles at Israel, though only a single one since the ceasefire was announced has managed to trigger warning sirens, with the rest falling outside of Israeli territory.\nAs US President Donald Trump makes his way to Riyadh, sources tell Reuters that both the Americans and Saudis will likely avoid the topic of normalization with Israel during talks, which are expected to focus on economic deals rather than diplomacy or statecraft.\nTrump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said last week that he imminently expected progress on expanding the Abraham Accords, a set of deals brokered by Trump in his first term under which Arab states including the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco recognized Israel.\nBut opposition by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a permanent stop to the war in Gaza or to the creation of a Palestinian state makes progress on similar talks with Riyadh unlikely, sources tell Reuters.\nTrump is expected to land at Riyadh’s King Khalid International Airport at 9:45 a.m. He is slated to hold meetings with Saudi leaders starting at noon, according to the White House.\nTrump’s second and third stops – in Qatar on Wednesday and the UAE on Thursday – are similarly expected to focus on economic issues.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip says an Israeli attack on Khan Younis’s Nasser Hospital killed two people and injured an unspecified number of others, including patients receiving treatment and medical staff. It does not immediately name the casualties.\nReports earlier indicated that among those killed was Hassan Eslaiah, whom the Israel Defense Forces said last month was a member of Hamas’s Khan Younis Brigade.\nOn October 7, Eslaiah, who was freelancing for the Associated Press, took photos of a burning tank on the Gaza border which had been attacked by Hamas operatives. He also invaded Israel with the terrorists and photographed them entering Kibbutz Nir Oz, where dozens of civilians were massacred. “During the massacre, he documented and uploaded footage of looting, arson, and murder to social media,” the IDF said last month.\nThe IDF announced in early April that it had targeted Eslaiah in an airstrike, but he managed to survive.\nThe IDF said overnight it carried out a “targeted strike” on “key” Hamas operatives inside the hospital compound, but did not say if any were killed in the strike.\nThe Gaza toll cannot be verified. Gazan health authorities in general do not differentiate between combatants and civilians.\nThe IDF says that its forces carried out a “targeted attack” on “key” Hamas operatives who were operating a command center in the Nasser Hospital compound in Khan Younis.\nPalestinian media reported multiple casualties in the strike.\nAmong those reported killed is Hassan Eslaiah, whom the IDF and Shin Bet have previously said was a member of Hamas’s Khan Younis Brigade.\nOn October 7, Eslaiah, who was freelancing for the Associated Press, took photos of a burning tank on the Gaza border which had been attacked by Hamas operatives. He also invaded Israel with the terrorists and photographed them entering Kibbutz Nir Oz, where dozens of civilians were massacred. “During the massacre, he documented and uploaded footage of looting, arson, and murder to social media,” the IDF said last month.\nThe IDF announced in early April that it had targeted Eslaiah in an airstrike, but he managed to survive.\nתקיפת צה\"ל בח'אן יונס: על פי דיוחים בעזה, בין ההרוגים ה\"עיתונאי\" העזתי חסן אצליח שצילם את עצמו ב- 7 באוקטובר | תיעוד @ItayBlumental https://t.co/RCejA4XaEn pic.twitter.com/dEYXaTNm3d\n— כאן חדשות (@kann_news) May 13, 2025\nThe army asserts in a statement that the Nasser compound continues to be used by Hamas operatives to plan attacks against Israel.\nThe IDF notes that Ismail Barhoum, a senior Hamas official, was killed in a strike on the same hospital in March.\nBarhoum was a member of Hamas’s political bureau, chief of the terror group’s finances and the successor to Issam Da’alis, the de-facto prime minister of Gaza, who was also killed in March.\n“Senior Hamas terrorist organization officials continue to use the hospital for terror purposes, cynically and cruelly exploiting the civilian population in and around the hospital,” the IDF statement says.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told lawmakers during closed-door testimony before the the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee yesterday that Israel is “destroying more and more houses [in Gaza and Palestinians accordingly] have nowhere to return,” according to quotes from the session leaked to the media.\n“The only obvious result will be Gazans choosing to emigrate outside of the Strip,” Netanyahu continued. “But our main problem is finding countries to take them in.”\nNetanyahu told the lawmakers that he has discussed Donald Trump’s plan for the US to take over Gaza with the president in recent days but acknowledged that there have been difficulties in implementing it.\nWhile Trump initially called on Egypt and Jordan to take in Palestinians, both countries quickly pushed back against the idea, insisting that Palestinians should be allowed to remain on their land.\nIsrael has also refrained from publicly assuring Gazans that those who leave will be allowed to return, further reducing the incentive for countries to take in Gazans, given the perception that they’d be interfering in a decades-old conflict over land.\nDozens who have left Gaza a pilot program for work abroad have reportedly been required to sign documents acknowledging that there is no timeline for when they can come back due to the security situation. Children who have been evacuated for medical treatment abroad have also been prevented from reuniting with their families back in Gaza after the completion of their hospital stay.\nDuring Sunday’s Knesset committee meeting, Netanyahu claimed that despite the lack of success in finding countries to take in Gazans, the US is still interested in taking over Gaza.\nSources familiar with the matter have told The Times of Israel, however, that the Trump administration has put minimal effort into actually advancing Trump’s Gaza takeover plan since it was announced in early February following the massive pushback it received from Arab allies.\nStill, Netanyahu told the lawmakers. “I know I will disappoint some people here, but we are not talking about Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip right now.”\nMK Limor Son Har-Melech replied, “Bring the Jews of the United States (to settle Gaza). That way, we can kill two birds with one stone,” according to partial transcripts from the meeting leaked to the Maariv daily.\nNetanyahu also briefed the committee on Israel’s plan to soon resume the distribution of aid in Gaza through a new system that aims to prevent assistance from being diverted by Hamas.\nNetanyahu said that those who pick up aid from newly established distribution hubs in southern Gaza will be barred from returning to places in Gaza outside of the new humanitarian zone being set up in southern Gaza. Israel’s aid plan envisions squeezing Gaza’s entire population of 2 million people into an area in and surrounding Rafah that makes up between 10 and 25 percent of the Strip. Those entering will be vetted by the IDF, according to officials briefed on the plan.\nA new organization called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation was established in order to manage the new aid program. GHF was supposed to announce its rollout last week but has faced major setbacks after the UAE, the UN and other international bodies refused to cooperate or fund the initiative due to concerns that it doesn’t adequately address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where aid has been banned by Israel since March 2.\nJacob Magid contributed to this report.\nIsrael’s Government Press Office releases additional footage and pictures from former American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander reuniting with his grandmother Varda Ben Baruch and other family members at Sourasky Hospital in Tel Aviv.\nAlexander can be heard telling Ben Baruch that he saw her on the news. It is not immediately clear if he meant that he saw her while he was in captivity or since his release earlier today.\nSyrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa will not attend the Arab League Summit in Baghdad this weekend, Syrian state media says, after Iraq’s invitation spurred controversy over the rebel-turned-leader’s potential return to a country where he fought and was jailed.\nSyria’s delegation to Saturday’s summit will be headed by Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani, state-owned Ekhbariya TV reports, without providing a reason for Sharaa’s absence. The summit is expected to focus on Gaza reconstruction and the Palestinian issue.\nSharaa’s decision highlights Syria’s mixed results establishing ties across the region after former President Bashar al-Assad’s ouster last year. Sharaa has made rapid inroads with Sunni-majority Gulf Arab states Saudi Arabia and Qatar, but has tread more carefully with others where Iran has had strong influence, like Shi’ite-majority Iraq.\nSharaa fought with Al Qaeda in Iraq after the U.S-led invasion in 2003. He was imprisoned there for more than five years, then released for lack of evidence in 2011, according to a senior Iraqi security official.\nHe then opened Al Qaeda’s branch in Syria, breaking away in 2016 to form what became Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group that ousted Assad.\nIraq’s prime minister invited Sharaa last month to the summit, prompting criticism from mainly Shi’ite Muslim factions who accuse Sharaa of orchestrating attacks against Shi’ites during his years in Iraq.\nThe US military is replacing its B-2 bombers with another type of bomber at a base in the Indo-Pacific that was seen as being in an ideal location to operate in the Middle East, US officials tell Reuters.\nThe Pentagon deployed as many as six B-2 bombers in March to a US-British military base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, amid a US bombing campaign in Yemen and mounting tensions with Iran.\nExperts say that this had put the B-2s, which have stealth technology and are equipped to carry the heaviest US bombs and nuclear weapons, in a position to operate in the Middle East.\nThe officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, say the B-2 bombers were being replaced by B-52 bombers.\nThe Pentagon says it does not comment on force posture adjustments as a matter of policy.\nFresh talks between Iranian and US negotiators to resolve disputes over Tehran’s nuclear program ended in Oman on Sunday, with further negotiations planned.\nThe fourth round of talks took place ahead of President Donald Trump’s planned visit to the Middle East. Trump, who has threatened military action against Iran if diplomacy fails, has restored a “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran since returning to the White House in January.\nTehran is willing to negotiate some curbs on its nuclear work in return for the lifting of sanctions, according to Iranian officials, but ending its enrichment program or surrendering its enriched uranium stockpile are among what the officials have called “Iran’s red lines that could not be compromised” in the talks.\nAdditionally, Trump announced last week that a deal had been reached to stop bombing Yemen’s Houthi group. The B-2 bombers had been used to carry out strikes against the Iran-backed group.",

The PMO also rejects a Walla report that the Shin Bet security agency is concerned about the meeting taking place amid the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan, where the City of David is located. “Contrary to the false [Walla] report, the Shin Bet raised no objections to holding the event in the City of David. On the contrary, preliminary checks and coordination were conducted with Shin Bet security officials, who approved the event at this location,” the PMO says. Earlier, Walla reported that the Shin Bet had expressed concern over its ability to secure a cabinet meeting at the archaeological site and national park, as well as provide the necessary protection for the prime minister and other ministers to reach the location. The Shin Bet recommended finding an alternate spot, but officials in the PMO nevertheless instructed the security services to prepare a plan for securing the cabinet meeting in the City of David, the report said. Jerusalem Day, which celebrates Israel’s capture of the Old City and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Six Day War, starts this year on May 25 in the evening and continues until May 26 in the evening.",

        "content": "US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff told the families of hostages held in Gaza earlier today that Hamas is “afraid of Donald Trump” and “should be.” In brief footage from the lengthy meeting he and US hostage envoy Adam Boehler held with the families in Tel Aviv, broadcast on Kan TV, Witkoff relates that newly released hostage Edan Alexander is “doing better than I would have thought. They actually treated him better. So for those who have relatives who are alive, I think that’s an important data point.” Witkoff elaborates: “Edan told me that when the president was elected, he began to get treated well. And that’s a really interesting data point — that people evidently are being treated better there, because Hamas is afraid of Donald Trump. And the truth is, they should be.” In a separate audio clip broadcast on Channel 12, Witkoff is heard telling the families that if a diplomatic deal cannot be reached to solve the hostage crisis, it will be one of the worst failures of his life. “The last thing I wanted to do was to call the Alexander family and give them notice of this thing,” Witkoff says, referring to Edan’s release, “because we thought six weeks ago we were getting him out, by the way, and he was going to be part of a larger release. And we were close. And, like that, it didn’t happen.” Now, says Witkoff, “everything is moving in the direction of: create a deal to diplomatically solve it. And if we can’t diplomatically solve it, it’s going to be, in my view — I’m not going to speak for Adam, okay — but to me, it will be one of the worst failures that I can ever endure in my life.” Channel 12 also reports that Alexander, on his release yesterday, immediately told Israeli officials and Witkoff that Matan Zangauker must be urgently returned. He was held with Zangauker for the past eight months, the report says. Zangauker’s mother, Einav, has said they were held together in the same tunnel, with no other hostages. Edan’s report on Matan was conveyed to Einav, the TV report says, leaving her in tears and more worried than ever for her son, who has medical issues.",

        "content": "Yael and Adi Alexander, parents of released hostage Edan Alexander, give a statement to reporters at Tel Aviv’s Sourasky Hospital, a day after he was released home after 584 days in Hamas captivity. They are surrounded by their other two children and other family members, all holding signs of other hostages still held in captivity. Yael Alexander, speaking in Hebrew, and Adi Alexander, speaking in English, thank US President Donald Trump and his Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and hostage envoy Adam Boehler, for their work in bringing their son home. “President Trump, Steve Witkoff and Adam Boehler worked day and night to bring back my son,” says Yael Alexander. “We’ll never be able to express what that means to us, but we’ll never forget the tireless effort on Edan’s behalf; we are in their debt,” says Adi Alexander. Yael Alexander thanks the Israeli public for supporting her and her family in their effort to bring Edan home. She does not thank the Israeli government, and they notably avoid thanking Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has argued that Israeli military pressure contributed to the release. “Most of the public believes that bringing back the hostages is the most important goal, a national and Jewish goal,” she says. “It’s not about right or left, but about the human heart.” She calls on the Netanyahu government to heed that call. “I say that the return of Edan should be only the beginning of bringing back the rest of the hostages,” she says. “We have no time to wait. The time is running out and the world is watching us.” Yael Alexander describes what her son has told them so far, about the terrible fears in captivity, the lack of water, the lack of food and aid, and the terror experienced when the IDF would strike Gaza, destroying buildings and bringing the fear of death to the captives. “The strikes and bombs made him think that every moment was about to be his last one,” she says. “Edan, my hero, you returned from the disaster. But other hostages are still living through that threat, they are still living in that hell. My heart has resumed beating, but they still need to return home.” Adi Alexander emphasizes in English what his wife says in Hebrew. He mentions that his son, a dual American-Israeli citizen who was serving in the IDF as a lone soldier, will soon return home to the US, to New Jersey, to his life, family and friends. “This isn’t just about our family,” says Adi Alexander. “Tomorrow, a new set of negotiations will begin that could lead to more hostages coming home and eventually the end of this war.” “For me and my family, the effort to bring home all 58 hostages will continue until they’re all at home. Hopefully, these negotiations will lead to that moment.”",

But with that said, Iran can have a much brighter future,” he adds. “This is an offer that will not last forever. The time is right now for them to choose… Things are happening at a very fast pace,” Trump says. He calls Iran the “most destructive force” in the Middle East, and blames the regime for instability across the region.

        "content": "Education Minister Yoav Kisch threatens to revoke funding for universities holding events to commemorate the Palestinian “Nakba,” or catastrophe, after student groups begin their annual demonstrations. “Academia is not a platform for incitement under the guise of freedom of expression,” Kisch writes in a post on X. He says he has appealed to Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich to revoke funding for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv University following events that took place on their campuses with their support. Smotrich later says in a statement that he supports the move and will “instruct the professional authorities to immediately act on revoking the funding.” Tension around marking the Nakba, which refers to the flight or displacement of an estimated 700,000 Palestinians around when Israel was created in 1948, are nothing new. Many Israelis view the commemorations as a veiled attempt to undermine the state’s existence. Arab student groups at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem said yesterday that commemorating Nakba Day, traditionally marked on May 15, is even more essential this year “as the genocide against our people in Gaza continues.” “Let us raise our voices against this genocide and displacement,” a statement from the groups said, adding that they would pass the day reading letters and poems from people in the war-torn territory. Both Tel Aviv University and the Hebrew University say in statements that they support their students’ rights to mark the day and call the minister’s threats illegal. “Tel Aviv University categorically rejects the education minister’s appalling threats to take illegal action and withhold funding from the university,” Tel Aviv University says in a statement, adding that under Israeli law, “demonstrations initiated by students on Nakba Day, which is held at most Israeli universities, are protected by the freedom of expression and protest.” The Hebrew University responds similarly, saying that Kisch’s “directive is without any legal foundation or statutory support.” “The Hebrew University is committed to fostering coexistence across all sectors of Israeli society,” the statement says. “As part of its dedication to freedom of expression, the university ensures that diverse voices can be heard — embracing complexity in dialogue and encouraging mutual respect.” Kisch responds on X that embracing such events “prevents academic freedom,” and that “any students who think that Nakba Day is a national day of mourning are invited to study at Birzeit University and not at the university of the first Zionist city in Israel.” Birzeit is a university in the West Bank. Kisch says that under the law, institutions supporting Nakba Day activities should expect to have their budgets denied.",

        "content": "Calling the enlistment of yeshiva students “an essential security need,” Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara urges the IDF to begin sending conscription orders to all draft-age ultra-Orthodox men at the start of the next recruitment cycle in July. The High Court’s provisional order from April demanding to know why the government has failed to enforce enlistment orders constitutes a “red flag,” the Attorney General’s Office declares, arguing that the current scope of Haredi recruitment is “far from meeting the needs of the army.” In a document summarizing a recent meeting with senior military and civilian officials, the Attorney General’s Office insists that as long as a new law regulating the status of yeshiva students is not enacted, “from a legal perspective, the state is legally obligated to act according to existing law, and to implement the general conscription obligation in an equal and uniform manner in relation to the entire population.” As such, Baharav-Miara welcomes IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir’s recent instructions to the IDF Personnel Directorate “to significantly increase the scope of conscription orders for members of the ultra-Orthodox public and to increase enforcement against evaders generally.” Out of 18,915 Haredim who received initial draft orders since July 2024, around 319 have enlisted, while 2,521 who have ignored multiple draft orders have been sent immediate call-up orders requiring them to show up at an induction center within 48 hours or be declared a draft evader. Of these, 964 have been declared draft evaders, a number expected to rise significantly in the coming weeks, the Attorney General’s Office states. The consequences of being declared a draft evader include receiving a “no exit order” — being barred from leaving the country. In addition, during any encounter with the police, the draft dodger can be arrested.",

The sources spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. Israel has owned F-35s for nine years, building multiple squadrons. Governments in the Gulf have long sought the most advanced fighter jet, built with stealth technology allowing it to evade enemy detection. If the US is to approve the transfer, Saudi Arabia would be only the second Middle East state after Israel to operate F-35 fighters.",

Trump, who is accompanied by a host of US business leaders, including billionaire Elon Musk, will go on from Riyadh to Qatar tomorrow and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.

Regarding the first incident, PA security forces spokesperson Anwar Rajab states that a PA force returned fire after being shot at during an arrest operation in the Tubas area. He adds that the slain man was “one of the symbols of the security chaos in the area.” In the second incident in Jenin, a video circulates showing an elderly man shot dead in his car, but the PA security forces have not yet issued an official response. It is rare for PA security forces to shoot and kill Palestinians. About six months ago, they launched an unusual operation in the Jenin refugee camp aimed at combating terror operatives involved in attacks.

        "content": "US President Donald Trump appears to confirm that he will meet with interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa during his swing through Saudi Arabia. Leaving the King Abdul Aziz International Conference Center, Trump stops for a moment before getting into his limousine to answer a shouted question from a reporter, who asks if he is meeting the Syrian president. Nodding, Trump says, “I think so,” before climbing in the vehicle. According to the London Times, citing unnamed security sources, Sharaa may use the meeting to offer talks on normalizing relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords. Syrian activists and Gulf Arab states have been trying to arrange a landmark meeting between the two leaders this week on the sidelines of Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Sharaa spoke with Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Sunday, according to the Syrian presidency.",

        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a meeting with wounded IDF reservists last night that Israel may agree to a short-term ceasefire for the release of hostages, but will not end the war under any circumstances until Hamas is defeated, according to the Prime Minister’s Office. “The situation has changed. In the coming days, we will go in [to Gaza] with full force to complete the operation. Completing the operation means subduing Hamas. It means destroying Hamas,” the premier tells the reservists, in a video shared by the PMO. “Eliminating Hamas and freeing all our hostages — these go hand in hand. That’s how we’re doing this,” continues Netanyahu. As Israel sends a delegation to Doha for final efforts at reaching a ceasefire-hostage deal before US President Donald Trump concludes his Middle East visit, Netanyahu says: “Maybe Hamas will say, ‘Wait — we want to release 10 more [hostages].’ Fine, bring them. We’ll take them. And then we’ll go in. But there will be no situation where we stop the war.” “A temporary ceasefire — fine. But we’re going all the way,” the premier says. “We’ve already set up a governing body that will allow [civilians] to exit, but the main issue is this — we need host countries willing to absorb them. That’s what we’re working on right now,” he adds. “If we give them a way out, I’m telling you — more than 50% will leave. In my opinion, many more. But Hamas will not remain there,” he says. The reservists, who are members of the “Wounded Soldiers for Victory” forum, “expressed support for Netanyahu’s leadership in pursuing victory and achieving all the war’s objectives, and urged him to decisively defeat the terrorist organization Hamas,” the PMO says. “You are an example and an inspiration, and with your spirit, we are heading toward total victory,” he tells the group.",

        "content": "The United States, in coordination with Qatar, agreed to push Israel to accept a months-long ceasefire and hostage exchange deal in return for the release of American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, Axios reports. During Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman al-Thani’s visit to the White House last month, the Gulf state leader met with US President Donald Trump and US special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, and suggested that they support a Hamas-approved proposal for a deal to release all hostages and end the war, but Washington said a temporary, phased deal was the only viable option, according to the outlet. Upon returning to Doha, al-Thani encouraged Hamas to make a gesture to Trump in order to change the president’s position, shortly after which Hamas reached out to Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian-American businessman and Trump supporter, to mediate talks with the US on the proposal, officials said in the report. The existence of this backchannel was first reported by The Times of Israel. The White House subsequently told the terror group that if Alexander were released, the US would pressure Israel to implement a 70- to 90-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of 10 hostages, during which negotiations for a final deal would be held, according to a Palestinian official quoted in the report. The US, Qatar and Egypt would ensure that the war wouldn’t resume throughout the talks, the official adds, though the US did not confirm this to Axios. Al-Thani played a critical role in persuading Hamas to agree to a deal, while Netanyahu was highly involved and the IDF’s campaign in Gaza was “instrumental,” a senior US official says. For his part, Trump did not pressure Netanyahu during their phone call yesterday to roll back his plans for an expanded ground campaign in Gaza set to begin after Trump’s Middle East visit, Israeli officials tell Axios. Axios echoes other reports that Witkoff and US hostage envoy Adam Boehler will be traveling to Doha with Israeli negotiators today, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to a request from the Trump administration to send a negotiating team to jumpstart the stalled hostage-ceasefire talks with Hamas. Netanyahu has stressed that negotiations would be conducted with Gaza “under fire” and that the military’s planned offensive to achieve control of the entire Strip will still go ahead if Hamas does not release more captives first.",

We call on the international community to support it,” says Sa’ar. On Sunday, Sa’ar announced in a joint press conference with his German counterpart that Israel “fully endorses” what he called an American plan for providing aid to the Gaza Strip, though officials familiar with the mechanism have told The Times of Israel that the Israeli government and military have been heavily involved in putting the scheme together. “We hope our objectives are achieved and that this war ends soon. We want to return to the path of expanding the circle of peace and normalization in the Middle East,” says Sa’ar in Japan, where he arrived this morning for the first official visit to the G7 country by an Israeli foreign minister since 2010. “Hamas started this war on October 7 and is responsible for its continuation by refusing to release our hostages and refusing to disarm…The October 7 attack caused a regional war. And this fundamental thing must be changed,” says Sa’ar, adding that, “with a terrorist state like Hamas — we will not be able to ensure regional stability.” “We are truly grateful for Japan’s steadfast support for Israel after Hamas’s horrific attack on October 7. You clearly condemned Hamas and recognized Israel’s right to self-defense,” Sa’ar tells Iwaya, adding that Japan was swift to impose sanctions on three Hamas leaders and call for the immediate release of the hostages in Gaza. “This visit is a special opportunity to strengthen our bilateral relations. We would like to do it in economy, defense, innovation, science, technology and people to people,” continues the foreign minister. Sa’ar thanks his counterpart for his hospitality and invites him to visit Israel soon.",

        "content": "In an official statement, the IDF says it has launched a “routine” Military Police campaign to detain those who ignored enlistment orders following the latest round of call-ups. “Last night, there was an [arrest] operation close to the draft period as has been carried out previously, in an equal manner across all sects of society and against anyone who did not show up as required,” the IDF says. The comment comes after a report that the army would launch large-scale arrest raids tomorrow targeting Haredi draft dodgers, which ignited a firestorm of protest among ultra-Orthodox politicians. The army says the campaign last night was aimed at a total of 36 people evading conscription, and not just ultra-Orthodox men. The IDF first made contact with those not showing up at induction centers, in an attempt to sort the matter out voluntarily, and would only afterward carry out arrests. It is unclear how many arrests actually took place. The detainees will either face disciplinary measures or a criminal trial, depending on how long they have ignored draft orders. In general, the Military Police’s arrest campaigns are aimed at those who have ignored draft orders recently, and therefore will only face disciplinary measures. It marks the third arrest campaign against draft dodgers since the beginning of the war, with the previous ones taking place in November 2024 and March 2025, according to the army. The Military Police have been occupied with war-related tasks, therefore only three such operations have been carried out. The military notes that last week, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir instructed the Personnel Directorate to bring forward an immediate plan to “expand and maximize” the sending out of draft orders to members of the ultra-Orthodox community “The plan is currently being prepared,” the IDF says.",

Freed hostage Edan Alexander said he is weak but slowly recovering, in the phone call with Netanyahu earlier in the day, in a video of the call shared by the premier’s office. “Craziness, craziness, it’s unbelievable,” Alexander says at the top of the call. Asked how he is feeling, the soldier replies haltingly, “I’m okay. Weak, but little by little, I’ll get back to what was before. It’s all a matter of time.” Netanyahu praises Israel’s medical teams for helping the ex-captive recover, and tells him, “You really sound like you’re on the right track,” ordering the 21-year-old to listen to their medical advice. The premier also says Israel is “rejoiced” following his return and that the country is ready to fight Hamas if no wider hostage deal is reached. US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff also participated in the call held during the envoy’s visit to the hospital where the dual national is recovering this morning. “You have one brave Israeli soldier there — who is also a champion of America and Israel together, and we’re very very happy and very grateful to the help you and President Trump gave us,” Netanyahu tells Witkoff in English. “And we of course value his [Alexander’s] comrades, the Israeli soldiers who are ready to take whatever action if our other friends, our other hostages, are not released, so it’s a great moment,” continues the premier. Witkoff responds by saying, “Mr. Prime Minister, I told Edan and his family everything you have done to make this possible over the last several days. It was a tense negotiation, and it was critical how you were, how you allowed the negotiations to operate, and that’s in large part the reason that Edan is home with his family today.”",

He tells reporters his meeting with Alexander in the hospital was “inspirational for all of us.” Noting that Alexander spoke by phone with Netanyahu, Witkoff says “the prime minister was incredible in this effort” to secure Alexander’s release. “It wouldn’t have happened without him.” Alexander also spoke to Trump, and “it was Donald Trump who guided this,” Witkoff says.",

        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is working “day and night” to return all hostages remaining in Gaza, after the brother of a soldier who went missing 43 years ago and was brought back to Israel this week thanked him for not giving up. “I was deeply moved to hear the words of Itzik Feldman at the funeral of his brother,” writes Netanyahu on X. On Sunday, Israel announced that it had recovered the remains of Sgt. First Class Zvi Feldman, who went missing along with two other troops during the battle of Sultan Yacoub during the First Lebanon War in 1982. A video attached to the prime minister’s post shows Feldman speaking at his brother’s funeral yesterday, recalling a protest families held some 30 years ago demanding the return of Feldman and other presumed captives. Netanyahu spoke to the families and promised to bring them home, he says. “His words expressed immense pain — but also hope and faith. We’re not stopping for a moment. We’re working day and night to bring back all our sons and daughters — all our hostages,” says the premier.",

The IDF in the coming weeks will complete sending out draft orders to 24,000 Haredi men, wrapping up an effort that began last summer but has seen only a handful enlist. Earlier this week, a military official acknowledged that in practice, the IDF had not been enforcing the draft orders it was sending out to the ultra-Orthodox, who have traditionally been granted exemptions from military service. Haredi politicians are attempting to legislate new rules aimed at reinstating those exemptions after courts found them to be unconstitutional. “We don’t enforce the draft orders for the ultra-Orthodox enough,” the official said. “There is almost no enforcement of them.” Previous attempts to enforce draft orders have been met with large-scale protests from the community, including demonstrations that have turned violent.",

        "content": "US President Donald Trump begins his Mideast tour with a rare tarmac welcome from Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who warmly greets Trump as he steps off Air Force One. The pomp began before Trump even landed. Royal Saudi Air Force F-15s provided an honorary escort for Air Force One as it approached the kingdom’s capital. The two leaders retreat to a grand hall at the Riyadh airport, where Trump and his aides are served traditional Arabic coffee by waiting attendants wearing ceremonial gun-belts. The crown prince’s airport greeting underscores the close relationship the de facto ruler of the kingdom wants to have with the American leader. Typically, a provincial governor or another official will greet a foreign leader on arrival. King Salman once greeted US president Barack Obama at the airport on a trip to the kingdom, but then lower-ranking officials did as the kingdom grew angry over his stance on the 2011 Arab Spring and the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. US president Joe Biden also was greeted by a provincial governor on his 2022 trip to the kingdom, before having an awkward fist-bump with Prince Mohammed, whom he had derided as a “pariah” during his election campaign after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.",

When you are leading the world, there is a way of doing things, there is a method, consistency.” He describes the lack of coordination between Washington and Jerusalem on regional issues, including negotiating the release of hostage Edan Alexander, as “a serious thing.

At a “Media Oasis” set up for journalists, giant video screens show off Saudi construction projects like its futuristic NEOM city and its hosting of the 2034 FIFA World Cup. A mobile McDonald’s sits in the parking lot, still shuttered. Saudi Arabia’s tightly controlled media is joining in the charm offensive, describing the visit as part of a strategic reset in American-Saudi relations, which date back to when then-President Franklin Roosevelt met King Saud aboard the USS Quincy in 1945. “Many countries around the world, including in Europe, are following Saudi Arabia’s lead in managing their affairs with Trump,” writes Abdulrahman al-Rashed in Asharq Al-Awsat. “The era of relying solely on political and military alliances with Washington is over; the focus now is on forging shared interests.” Faisal J. Abbas writes in the English-language Arab News newspaper that “the significance of the visit cannot be overstated — nor could its timing be more crucial,” given Saudi Arabia’s mediation in the Russia-Ukraine war and the recent conflict between India and Pakistan. He also acknowledges business deals that will be a centerpiece of the trip. “Putting America first does not mean ignoring opportunities abroad; it means seizing them,” Abbas writes. Prince Turki al-Faisal, who led Saudi intelligence for more than two decades and served as ambassador to the US and Britain, addresses Trump in the same paper, writing that “our doors and hearts are open to you.”",

        "content": "US President Donald Trump ordered an end to a military campaign against Yemen’s Houthis after being frustrated by a lack of progress against the Iran-backed group and the mounting costs of the campaign, the New York Times reports. The Trump administration has portrayed the ceasefire, which included no guarantees regarding continued attacks against Israel or other non-US assets, as a victory, claiming the Houthis sued for peace after being degraded by two months of intense strikes. But according to the report, Trump had sought an off-ramp from the campaign after the Houthis continued to successfully resist US forces, who lost a number of Reaper drones and two F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets, giving the Pentagon 30 days to show results rather than pressing ahead with the original proposed plan for an eight- to 10-month engagement aimed at disabling the group. The paper, relying on unnamed former and current officials, reports that the campaign cost the US over $1 billion in its first month alone, and sparked fears that the US would be short munitions it could need to defend Taiwan against China, leading Trump to seek a way out. The initial proposal had called for air strikes to take out Houthi air defenses followed by a campaign of assassinations, largely modeled on Israel’s successful war against Hezbollah. Trump had only partially approved the plan, the paper reports. The idea for a truce was advanced by the Omanis via US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff as they brokered nuclear talks between Washington and Tehran, according to the Times. Israel was caught off guard by the US agreement to stop bombing the Houthis, which was announced days after a missile hit Ben Gurion airport, injuring several people and sparking heavy Israeli strikes on Houthi infrastructure, including Sana’a’s main airport. The Houthis have since continued to fire missiles at Israel, though only a single one since the ceasefire was announced has managed to trigger warning sirens, with the rest falling outside of Israeli territory.",

But opposition by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a permanent stop to the war in Gaza or to the creation of a Palestinian state makes progress on similar talks with Riyadh unlikely, sources tell Reuters. Trump is expected to land at Riyadh’s King Khalid International Airport at 9:45 a.m. He is slated to hold meetings with Saudi leaders starting at noon, according to the White House. Trump’s second and third stops – in Qatar on Wednesday and the UAE on Thursday – are similarly expected to focus on economic issues.",

        "caption": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits the Netzarim Corridor in the central Gaza Strip on November 19, 2024. (Maayan Toaf/GPO)",
        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told lawmakers during closed-door testimony before the the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee yesterday that Israel is “destroying more and more houses [in Gaza and Palestinians accordingly] have nowhere to return,” according to quotes from the session leaked to the media. “The only obvious result will be Gazans choosing to emigrate outside of the Strip,” Netanyahu continued. “But our main problem is finding countries to take them in.” Netanyahu told the lawmakers that he has discussed Donald Trump’s plan for the US to take over Gaza with the president in recent days but acknowledged that there have been difficulties in implementing it. While Trump initially called on Egypt and Jordan to take in Palestinians, both countries quickly pushed back against the idea, insisting that Palestinians should be allowed to remain on their land. Israel has also refrained from publicly assuring Gazans that those who leave will be allowed to return, further reducing the incentive for countries to take in Gazans, given the perception that they’d be interfering in a decades-old conflict over land. Dozens who have left Gaza a pilot program for work abroad have reportedly been required to sign documents acknowledging that there is no timeline for when they can come back due to the security situation. Children who have been evacuated for medical treatment abroad have also been prevented from reuniting with their families back in Gaza after the completion of their hospital stay. During Sunday’s Knesset committee meeting, Netanyahu claimed that despite the lack of success in finding countries to take in Gazans, the US is still interested in taking over Gaza. Sources familiar with the matter have told The Times of Israel, however, that the Trump administration has put minimal effort into actually advancing Trump’s Gaza takeover plan since it was announced in early February following the massive pushback it received from Arab allies. Still, Netanyahu told the lawmakers. “I know I will disappoint some people here, but we are not talking about Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip right now.” MK Limor Son Har-Melech replied, “Bring the Jews of the United States (to settle Gaza). That way, we can kill two birds with one stone,” according to partial transcripts from the meeting leaked to the Maariv daily. Netanyahu also briefed the committee on Israel’s plan to soon resume the distribution of aid in Gaza through a new system that aims to prevent assistance from being diverted by Hamas. Netanyahu said that those who pick up aid from newly established distribution hubs in southern Gaza will be barred from returning to places in Gaza outside of the new humanitarian zone being set up in southern Gaza. Israel’s aid plan envisions squeezing Gaza’s entire population of 2 million people into an area in and surrounding Rafah that makes up between 10 and 25 percent of the Strip. Those entering will be vetted by the IDF, according to officials briefed on the plan. A new organization called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation was established in order to manage the new aid program. GHF was supposed to announce its rollout last week but has faced major setbacks after the UAE, the UN and other international bodies refused to cooperate or fund the initiative due to concerns that it doesn’t adequately address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where aid has been banned by Israel since March 2.

The summit is expected to focus on Gaza reconstruction and the Palestinian issue. Sharaa’s decision highlights Syria’s mixed results establishing ties across the region after former President Bashar al-Assad’s ouster last year. Sharaa has made rapid inroads with Sunni-majority Gulf Arab states Saudi Arabia and Qatar, but has tread more carefully with others where Iran has had strong influence, like Shi’ite-majority Iraq. Sharaa fought with Al Qaeda in Iraq after the U.S-led invasion in 2003. He was imprisoned there for more than five years, then released for lack of evidence in 2011, according to a senior Iraqi security official. He then opened Al Qaeda’s branch in Syria, breaking away in 2016 to form what became Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group that ousted Assad. Iraq’s prime minister invited Sharaa last month to the summit, prompting criticism from mainly Shi’ite Muslim factions who accuse Sharaa of orchestrating attacks against Shi’ites during his years in Iraq.",

        "content": "The US military is replacing its B-2 bombers with another type of bomber at a base in the Indo-Pacific that was seen as being in an ideal location to operate in the Middle East, US officials tell Reuters. The Pentagon deployed as many as six B-2 bombers in March to a US-British military base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, amid a US bombing campaign in Yemen and mounting tensions with Iran. Experts say that this had put the B-2s, which have stealth technology and are equipped to carry the heaviest US bombs and nuclear weapons, in a position to operate in the Middle East. The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, say the B-2 bombers were being replaced by B-52 bombers. The Pentagon says it does not comment on force posture adjustments as a matter of policy. Fresh talks between Iranian and US negotiators to resolve disputes over Tehran’s nuclear program ended in Oman on Sunday, with further negotiations planned. The fourth round of talks took place ahead of President Donald Trump’s planned visit to the Middle East. Trump, who has threatened military action against Iran if diplomacy fails, has restored a “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran since returning to the White House in January. Tehran is willing to negotiate some curbs on its nuclear work in return for the lifting of sanctions, according to Iranian officials, but ending its enrichment program or surrendering its enriched uranium stockpile are among what the officials have called “Iran’s red lines that could not be compromised” in the talks. Additionally, Trump announced last week that a deal had been reached to stop bombing Yemen’s Houthi group. The B-2 bombers had been used to carry out strikes against the Iran-backed group.",

    "article": "Al Jazeera’s Ramallah bureau chief said Monday that the news channel can resume working in the West Bank, after Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas lifted a ban that had been in place since January.\n“Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has decided to lift the ban on the Al Jazeera network and allow its crews to resume work in the Palestinian territories starting tomorrow morning,” Waleed Omari said, in a statement to the Israeli-Palestinian Foreign Press Association.\nA Palestinian official confirmed the removal of the ban to AFP, but the PA did not issue a formal announcement.\nThe Palestinian Authority in January ordered the temporary suspension of Al Jazeera broadcasts across the West Bank, against the backdrop of the Qatari network’s critical coverage of Ramallah’s crackdown on terror groups in the territory.\nThe PA accused the network of “misinformation, incitement, sedition and interference in Palestinian internal affairs.”\nIn late December, Al Jazeera had condemned what it said was an “incitement campaign” by PA President Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah party against the network in some areas of the West Bank.\n“This campaign follows the network’s coverage of clashes between Palestinian security forces and resistance fighters in Jenin,” Al Jazeera said in a statement at the time, lionizing the anti-PA fighters, many of whom were affiliated with the Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror groups.\nThe Qatari broadcaster has close ties with Hamas and has long been accused of having a distinct anti-Israel slant.\nThe network is already banned from broadcasting from Israel, amid a long-running feud with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, which has only worsened during the ongoing war in Gaza. Israeli officials have long complained about Al Jazeera’s coverage, which they say is heavily influenced by Hamas and endangers IDF troops in Gaza.\nA court, reviewing the temporary ban, determined that there was a “close connection” between Al Jazeera and Hamas, that some Al Jazeera reporters in Gaza had turned themselves into “assistants and partners” with Hamas, and that some of them had even carried out terror attacks.",

    "date": "Updated 01:10 AM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "BERLIN, Germany — President Isaac Herzog on Monday became the first foreign leader to be hosted by new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, just six days after he took the helm of Germany’s government, with Berlin and Jerusalem marking 60 years of strong diplomatic ties, though some cracks have emerged as the war in Gaza drags on.\n“The friendship between Germany and Israel is a great treasure that must be preserved 80 years after the Holocaust perpetrated by Germany,” wrote Merz on X after meeting Herzog, adding that he was honored to welcome him “as the first foreign guest of my term in office.”\nThe two leaders did not make any public comments before or after their meeting, although Herzog’s office said the president stressed during their conversation addressed the hostages remaining in Gaza, including nine with German citizenship.\n“We are pleading, demanding and asking the international community to intervene,” Herzog told Merz, according to his office. “Nine of the hostages hold German citizenship. I therefore appeal from here, on behalf of the State of Israel on behalf of my nation, to the international leadership to do everything possible to bring about change.”\nDuring the final moments of their meeting, Herzog and Merz watched together the release of hostage Edan Alexander, who was freed from the Gaza Strip on Monday in a deal between Hamas and the United States after 584 days in captivity. Merz also showed Herzog a photo hanging in his office of the Zikim Beach, where Hamas terrorists murdered 17 civilians on October 7, 2023.\nThe meeting capped off a whirlwind day for Herzog in Berlin, beginning with an official state welcome ceremony at the Bellevue presidential palace, where he sat down with his longtime friend and close ally of Israel President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. The pair then held a joint press conference during which they lauded their nations’ warm ties, even as some criticism was aired from the country that has emerged as Israel’s strongest defender in Europe.\nStanding alongside Herzog, Steinmeier urged Israel to immediately resume humanitarian aid into Gaza, saying the suffering of Palestinians in the Strip needed to end.\nIsrael must “ensure that humanitarian aid reaches the people of Gaza as quickly as possible… not at some future point, but now,” said Steinmeier. He stressed that Germany understands the dilemma of Hamas embedding in the civilian population and stealing aid that enters the Strip; nevertheless, “the suffering of Gaza’s civilian population” deeply concerns both Germany and Israel’s other friends.\nHe also noted that the aid agency UNRWA, which Israel has accused of being entangled with Hamas, “is not a worthy partner, so we have to find alternatives” for the distribution of aid.\nIn his own response, Herzog called on the international community to take part in a new aid mechanism to “enable the distribution of aid directly to the people of Gaza,” referring to a newly unveiled US-backed aid plan to circumvent Hamas.\nSteinmeier said the establishment of relations with Israel in 1965 was “a gift that we Germans could not have expected after the horrors of the Second World War,” while Herzog said the countries’ reconciliation and close relations was “a source of hope.”\nThe German president suggested that Israel needs to seize the opportunities in front of it in order to forge new partnerships with unlikely future allies.\n“Germany stands ready to engage with Israel’s neighbors and support dialogue toward a serious political solution,” he said, referring to recent trips to “Cairo, Amman, Qatar and especially Riyadh” as highlighting a “window of opportunity” for Israel, with regard to possible normalization with Saudi Arabia.\n“I am concerned that this openness might be lost and that the window of opportunity might soon close,” added Steinmeier. “Therefore, I urge us all to seize the opportunity that still exists, together with other countries, and to work toward a political solution for the sake of the future.”\nHerzog, who has long expressed his support for wider peace efforts, declared that “there is nothing I want more than to shake the hands of Sheikh Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, as a rapprochement of Jew and Muslim in the region.”\nOn Monday evening, Herzog was hosted at a state dinner by Steinmeier, and earlier in the day he also met with the president of the Bundestag parliament, spent time with a local youth group, and visited a memorial at the Platform 17 train station from where thousands of Berlin Jews were deported to their deaths during the Holocaust.\nSteinmeier is slated to follow Herzog back to Israel on Tuesday, where he will visit the hard-hit Kibbutz Be’eri in the south, meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and also receive the Israeli Presidential Medal of Honor, as the countries continue to mark the anniversary of their formal establishment of diplomatic relations.\nMerz said earlier this year — before he was sworn in as chancellor — that he would invite Netanyahu to visit Germany despite the arrest warrant against the Israeli prime minister issued last year by the International Criminal Court.\nAsked on Monday if such a position was wise, Steinmeier said it was a question for the German government, but implied that it was not a good idea for Netanyahu to visit.\n“I assume and hope that both sides are clever enough to ensure that a decision never has to be taken on whether to enforce an international arrest warrant against an Israeli prime minister in Germany,” said Steinmeier.\nAgencies contributed to this report.",

    "subheading": "Officials see ‘window of opportunity’ ahead of Trump’s visit to the Mideast this week; Netanyahu stresses negotiations will be held ‘under fire,’ planned Gaza offensive still on",
    "date": "Updated 10:54 PM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "Israel will send a delegation to Doha, Qatar on Tuesday to try to negotiate a hostage-ceasefire deal to enable the release of the remaining Gaza captives, the Prime Minister’s Office announced on Monday.\nThe announcement came after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with US President Donald Trump, and following a meeting with US special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and US Ambassador Mike Huckabee.\nIt was issued shortly before the Hamas terror group released American-Israeli hostage soldier Edan Alexander, and before Trump embarked on his planned visit to the region.\nTrump said Alexander’s release — which Hamas presented as a goodwill gesture to the United States, via direct talks that excluded Israel — was part of a larger effort to end the war and return all hostages, as officials spoke of a “window of opportunity” for a larger deal.\nIn his meeting with Witkoff and Huckabee, Netanyahu discussed “the recent effort to implement the hostage release framework presented by Witkoff” ahead of the IDF’s potential expanded ground campaign in Gaza, the PMO said in its statement. “To that end, the prime minister instructed that a negotiation delegation be sent to Doha tomorrow.”\nNetanyahu stressed, however, that negotiations would be conducted “under fire” and that the military’s planned offensive to achieve control of the entire Gaza Strip would still go ahead if the terror group did not release more captives first.\nChannel 12 news reported that, in an earlier conference call, Netanyahu and his coalition partners green-lighted the resumption of talks, but reaffirmed Israel’s commitment to the “Witkoff framework.”\nIsrael’s Channel 13 news said Netanyahu subsequently told his coalition partners that Israel would negotiate only regarding the Witkoff framework, as opposed to a wider deal.\nThe framework would see a temporary ceasefire of some 40 days, in exchange for about half of the remaining living hostages, of whom there are believed to be 20-23. Israel remains opposed, however, to any deal that would require serious negotiations on a permanent end to the war, given what is currently off the table, such as Hamas leaving the Strip.\nA source who was present for the discussions told the network that though there was pessimism about the prospects of the fresh negotiations, coalition heads authorized Netanyahu to send the delegation, although National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich were opposed.\nTrump, speaking shortly before Alexander was freed from Hamas captivity, said that the hostage soldier’s release would be part of a wider effort to return all remaining captives — 58, excluding Alexander, of whom at least 20 are believed to be alive — and end the 19-month war.\n“This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n“Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict. I look very much forward to that day of celebration!” he added.\nAsked later by a reporter whether Alexander’s release would be a step toward a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, Trump said, “We hope that we’re going to have other hostages released.”\nSeparately, when answering a question about the Qatari ruling family offering to gift him a Boeing 747, the US president said he has “a lot of respect for the leadership” and “a lot of respect for the leader” of the Gulf state.\nUS Ambassador Huckabee wrote, in a post on X on Monday, that he was “relieved” to see Alexander freed, and echoed Trump’s comments about the state of the war.\n“As [President Trump] said, we hope that this long-overdue release marks the beginning of the end to this terrible war. Hamas alone is responsible for the continued death and suffering. We demand the immediate release of all remaining hostages,” he wrote.\nTrump’s special envoy on hostages, Adam Boehler, traveled to Israel on Monday with Edan Alexander’s mother, and said from the plane that the hostage soldier’s release is just “the start” and that he will not rest until all captives are returned home.\n“[US] President [Donald] Trump, when he told me to go get back every hostage, every Israeli, he wasn’t kidding,” Boehler said.\nEarlier, Boehler said news of Alexander’s release was a positive step forward. “We would also ask that Hamas release the bodies of four other Americans that were taken,” he then added.\nAmerican-Israelis Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai, Judih Weinstein Haggai, and Omer Neutra were among the approximately 1,200 people, mostly civilians, killed by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023, during the cross-border onslaught that started the ongoing war. Their bodies were taken to Gaza, along with 247 other hostages living and dead.\nTrump is slated to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates on his Middle East tour this week. He suggested Monday that he might also go to Turkey, but is not planning to stop in Israel.\nAn Israeli official told Channel 12 news that Trump’s arrival in the region, together with Alexander’s release, created a “dramatic window of opportunity” to advance a hostage deal, based on the so-called Witkoff framework.\nThe unnamed official said Israel is ready to send a negotiating team, “if and when we determine that conditions are ripe,” adding that “we hope Hamas seizes what may be its last chance to reach an agreement.”\nMeanwhile, CNN quoted a source familiar with the indirect talks between the US and Hamas as saying that Alexander’s release would immediately lead into talks for a wider arrangement, aimed at ending the war.\n“We’re going to go into immediate peace deal negotiations,” the source said.\nThe Kan public broadcaster reported that during Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, Riyadh will try to get his backing for a regional package deal that includes forming a demilitarized Palestinian state, ending the war in Gaza, while dismantling Hamas, and normalizing ties between Israel and Arab countries.\nThe outlet cited an unnamed official in the Saudi royal family as saying there is much optimism in Riyadh that Trump will be persuaded to support such a deal.\nThe official was cited as saying that some details can yet be changed, but a Palestinian state and stopping the war are non-negotiable components.\nIsrael must not miss the opportunity, the Saudi official contended.\nTrump also said Monday that he was considering flying to Turkey — not currently on the agenda — to join talks between Russia and Ukraine, aimed at ending the war that began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nHe also told reporters the White House may ease sanctions on Syria, following a query toward that end from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nSyria has struggled to implement conditions set out by Washington for relief from US sanctions, which keep the country cut off from the global financial system and make economic recovery extremely challenging, after 14 years of grinding war.\nStav Levaton and Jessica Steinberg contributed to this report.",

    "date": "Updated 07:52 PM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "The Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court ordered on Monday that Yonatan Urich, a close aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is a key suspect in the so-called Qatargate scandal, be released to house arrest for ten days.\nThe police had sought to keep Urich under house arrest for three weeks, but Judge Menachem Mizrahi cut that period in half.\nThe court also issued a travel ban against Urich until August 12, and banned him from contacting anyone involved in the case.\nUrich, together with Eli Feldstein, a former military affairs spokesperson for Netanyahu, is suspected of multiple offenses tied to their alleged work for a pro-Qatar lobbying firm. They are suspected of contact with a foreign agent and breach of trust, due to what prosecutors believe was their work to improve Doha’s image as a hostage negotiation mediator, while simultaneously working as advisers to Netanyahu.\nThe investigation has broadened and several former senior security officials are suspected of involvement in helping transfer money from Doha to Urich and Feldstein.\nMizrahi made unusual remarks during Monday’s custody hearing, indicating he does not believe Urich will ultimately be indicted.\nAfter Urich’s attorney Amit Hadad remarked that “the day will come when we see all the [investigative] material,” referring to when Urich is indicted, Mizrahi replied “Such a day will not come, it won’t happen,” indicating he believes that Netanyahu’s aide will not face charges.\nThe decision to file charges is ultimately in the hands of the State Attorney’s Office, but Mizrahi’s comments appear to reflect a belief that there is either insufficient evidence for charging Urich with the crimes he is suspected of, or that he has not actually committed a crime.\nLast Wednesday, Mizrahi raised substantive questions over the investigation, pointing out that although Urich was doing work for the prime minister, he was not employed as a formal employee of the Prime Minister’s Office and was therefore not a civil servant.\nOnly civil servants can be charged with crimes such as bribery and breach of trust, which the police wish to level against Urich.\nMizrachi’s comments were unexpected, as he previously argued with Urich’s attorney against claims that Urich is not a civil servant, noting previous court rulings establishing that it is the role filled by a suspect and not the formal position that person holds that determines civil servant status.\nUrich was rearrested last week after police sought to question him regarding what they said was new evidence that had emerged surrounding his role in the scandal, but the Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court ordered him to be released, saying there was no reason for his ongoing detention.\nThe Lod Central District Court upheld an appeal by the police to keep him in custody, saying the new evidence heightened suspicions against Urich, and the Supreme Court upheld that decision after Urich appealed.\nIn a subtle rebuke, however, the Supreme Court told police that if they wished to make further requests for Urich to remain in custody, they should focus on claims that he might pervert the course of justice if released, rather than asserting the supposed danger he poses to state security.",

    "article": "PARIS — Iran’s foreign minister warned Britain, France and Germany Monday that a decision to trigger a UN mechanism reimposing sanctions on Tehran could lead to an irreversible escalation of tensions.\nUnder the terms of a UN resolution ratifying a 2015 nuclear pact, the three European powers could reimpose United Nations sanctions against Tehran before October 18, known in diplomatic circles as the “snapback mechanism.”\nThey were said to be mulling the option as a form of diplomatic leverage, as the US seeks to ramp up pressure on Iran amid ongoing nuclear talks between the two countries.\n“Iran has made its position clear. We have officially warned all JCPOA [nuclear pact] signatories that abuse of the snapback mechanism will lead to consequences — not only the end of Europe’s role in the agreement, but also an escalation of tensions that could become irreversible,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote in a column in French weekly magazine Le Point.\nUS President Donald Trump exited Tehran’s 2015 nuclear accord with six world powers in 2018 during his first term and reimposed tough sanctions that devastated Iran’s economy.\nThe European powers are not part of current negotiations between Iran and the US, the fourth round of which ended in Oman Sunday. But the three powers have sought to coordinate closely with Washington with a view to whether and when they should use the snapback mechanism to raise pressure on Iran.\nTalks between the so-called E3 and Iran in Rome earlier in May were postponed. Araghchi said that a meeting between Iran’s deputy foreign minister and E3 counterparts had since taken place, describing them as a “promising, but fragile start.”\nFrance’s foreign ministry declined to comment. The British and German foreign ministries were not immediately available to comment.\nAccording to diplomats and a document seen by Reuters, the E3 countries may trigger a snapback by August if no substantial deal can be found by then. The window closes on October 18.\nRelations between the E3 and Iran have worsened over the last year despite sporadic meetings, against a backdrop of new sanctions imposed on Tehran over its ballistic missile program, its detention of foreign citizens and support for Russia in its war against Ukraine.\nIran, which has long denied having nuclear weapons and insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, has breached the 2015 pact’s nuclear curbs since 2019, including “dramatically” accelerating its enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% level that is weapons-grade, according to the UN nuclear watchdog.",

    "article": "Israel asked the International Criminal Court last week to withdraw arrest warrants that it issued for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant, as the ICC reviews Israeli challenges to its jurisdiction over the Gaza war.\nDocuments published on the ICC website late on Sunday, dated May 9, show Israel also asked the court to suspend the investigation of their alleged crimes until the judges rule on a jurisdictional challenge presented by Israel.\nThe documents are signed by Israeli Deputy Attorney General Gilad Noam.\nThey were published as ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan faces allegations of sexually assaulting a member of his staff, and amid speculation that these allegations spurred Khan to issue the warrants.\nThe ICC issued arrest warrants on November 21 for Netanyahu and Gallant over alleged war crimes amid the war in Gaza, including “starvation as a method of war.”\nIsrael rejects the jurisdiction of The Hague-based court. It also insists that its fighting in Gaza has accorded with international law, citing measures it has taken to avoid civilian casualties and to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid. It is contesting the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant.\nThe court also issued warrants for Hamas terror chiefs Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh for crimes against humanity during the October 7, 2023, onslaught — in which some 5,000 Hamas-led terrorists killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, starting the war — and beyond, but withdrew the warrants after all three were killed by Israel in separate incidents.\nIn April, the ICC’s appeals chamber ruled that the judges of the pre-trial chamber, which issued the warrants, must review Israel’s objections regarding the court’s jurisdiction and the legality of the arrest warrants.\nIt is unclear what form the ordered review will take, and there are no specific deadlines set for decisions on Israel’s request that warrants be withdrawn and the investigation halted.\nThe Israeli request was submitted a day before The Wall Street Journal, on Saturday, published a report detailing allegations that Khan forced sexual intercourse upon a member of staff on multiple occasions.\n“The timing of the announcement [of the warrants] has spurred questions about whether Khan was aiming to protect himself from the sexual-assault allegations,” the report noted.\nA day before announcing he applied for the warrants, Khan abruptly canceled a trip to Israel and Gaza, which he had previously said would be important for making a decision on the matter.\nKhan denies all wrongdoing, and has alleged that the accusations against him are part of an effort to undermine the ICC. The Journal report also said that court officials were concerned that the Mossad was operating at The Hague. No further details were given.\nKhan remains in his position, and the ICC did not respond to a Journal request for comment.",

    "date": "Updated 01:18 PM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced his new Cabinet on Monday after former minister Ed Husic blamed his demotion on his own criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza.\nAlbanese named the 30 lawmakers who will fill Cabinet and outer-ministry positions after his center-left Labor Party won a landslide victory in the May 3 elections.\nLabor has claimed 92 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, the lower chamber where parties need a majority to form government. As vote counting continues, Albanese said his government could hold as many as 95 seats.\nLabor had never held more seats since the first Parliament sat in 1901, he said.\n“I’m deeply humbled by the trust that was put into my government with the election, and we certainly won’t take it for granted,” Albanese told reporters at Parliament House.\nWhile Labor prime ministers allocate the ministerial portfolios, the party’s factional leaders pick the 30 lawmakers who will get them based on the proportion of seats each faction won.\nThe factional leaders dropped former industry and science minister Husic, who was born in Sydney to Bosnian Muslim immigrants, and former attorney-general Mark Dreyfus, who is Jewish.\nHusic, who, after the 2022 election, became Australia’s first federal minister to be sworn into office on a Quran, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. on Sunday that Albanese should have intervened to keep him and Dreyfus in Cabinet.\nHusic said his demotion was in part punishment for his views on how Israel has waged war against the Hamas terror group in Gaza.\n“I think it’s been a factor in there. Would I do things differently? I don’t think so,” Husic told ABC.\n“You can’t celebrate diversity and then expect it to sit in a corner and be silent. You need to speak up… for the communities that you care about,” Husic added.\nAlbanese did not directly answer when asked whether he had fought for either Husic or Dreyfus to remain in Cabinet.\n“We have a process in the Labor Party caucus. You’ve been watching it for some time,” Albanese told reporters.\nAlbanese said he had a “constructive discussion” with Husic on Monday morning.\n“What I’ve done is to allocate portfolios. That’s the system that’s there. It’s one that Ed and others have supported for a long period of time,” Albanese said.\nBilal Rauf, an adviser to the Australian National Imams Council, called for Albanese to explain whether Husic’s demotion was due to his views on Gaza.\n“I think at a minimum, some explanation is warranted. We can’t just leave it at explanations about factionalism,” Rauf said.\n“If Ed says that’s a factor, I have no reason to discount that,” Rauf said. “It’s hard to deny that it likely is a factor.”\nAlex Ryvchin, co-chief executive officer of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said his advocacy group had enjoyed good relations with both Dreyfus and Husic.\nHowever, Husic had made statements after Hamas’s massacre on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that were “very troublesome for the community.”\n“He levelled accusations at Israel which we fundamentally disagree with but again reasonable people will differ on these things and we wish Ed Husic all the best,” Ryvchin said.\nHusic said two weeks after the Hamas onslaught: “I feel very strongly that Palestinians are being collectively punished… for Hamas’ barbarism.”\nHusic said on Sunday the Israeli government had “atrociously managed this.”\nEgypt-born Anne Aly has been promoted to Cabinet, making her the government’s most senior Muslim. She is the minister for small business, international development and multicultural affairs.\nAlbanese’s second-term administration is the first Australian government since 2010 to have no Jewish Cabinet minister.\nMost of the government’s most senior ministers have portfolios that are unchanged or slightly varied.\nDeputy Prime Minister Richard Marles remained the defense minister. Home Affairs Tony Burke’s portfolio has been expanded to include the Australian Federal Police and the nation’s main domestic spy agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization.\nTim Ayres, the former assistant trade minister, was promoted to Cabinet to take Husic’s portfolio.\nDreyfus was replaced by Michelle Rowland, who had been the communications minister in the government’s first term.\nAustralia, over the past year, has largely departed from its policy of voting against or abstaining from pro-Palestinian resolutions in the UN.\nIn December, it voted in favor of a UN General Assembly resolution calling on Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza, and last May, it voted for a resolution recognizing the Palestinians as qualified to become a full UN member and recommending that the UN Security Council consider the matter.\nTimes of Israel staff contributed to this report.",

    "article": "NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian and Pakistani authorities said Monday there was no firing reported overnight along the heavily militarized region between their countries, the first time in recent days the two nations were not shooting at each other.\nIndia and Pakistan reached an understanding to stop all military actions on land, in the air and at the sea Saturday in a US-brokered ceasefire to stop the escalating hostilities between the two nuclear-armed rivals that threatened regional peace.\n“The night remained largely peaceful across Jammu and Kashmir, and other areas along the international border,” the Indian army said in a statement, adding that no incidents had been reported.\nSenior military officials from India and Pakistan are scheduled to speak later Monday to assess if the ceasefire was holding. There were fears it would not hold after they accused each other of violations just hours after it was announced.\nLocal government officials in Pakistan-administered Kashmir reported no incidents of cross-border firing along the Line of Control and said that civilians displaced by recent skirmishes between Pakistani and Indian forces were returning to their homes.\nPakistan’s military spokesperson, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif, said late Sunday that Pakistan remains committed to upholding the ceasefire and will not be the first to violate it.\nHe also confirmed that senior military officials from both nations would speak by phone on Monday.\nSoon after the ceasefire announcement on Saturday, Pakistan reopened all of its airports and restored flight operations. India followed up Monday with reopening of all the 32 airports that were shut temporarily across northern and western regions amid the flare-up in tensions.\n“It’s informed that these airports are now available for civil aircraft operations with immediate effect,” the Airports Authority of India said in a statement.\nThe militaries of the two countries have been engaged in one of their most serious confrontations in decades since last Wednesday, when India struck targets inside Pakistan it said were affiliated with militants responsible for the massacre of 26 tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir. The tourists, mostly Indian Hindu men, were brutally killed in front of their families in the meadow town of Pahalgam last month.\nIndia accused Pakistan of backing the militants who carried out the massacre, a charge Islamabad denied. The incident first led to a spat of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures by both the nations, sending their bilateral ties to a near historic low.\nThe two expelled each other’s diplomats, shut their airspace, land borders, and suspended a crucial water treaty.\nAfter Wednesday’s strikes in Pakistan, both sides exchanged heavy fires along their de facto border in the restive Kashmir region followed by missile and drone strikes into each other’s territories, mainly targeting military installations and airbases. Dozens of civilians were killed on both sides in heavy shelling, the two countries said.\nThe Indian military on Sunday for the first time claimed its strikes into Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and Pakistan last week killed more than 100 militants, including prominent leaders.\nLt. Gen. Rajiv Ghai, the director general of India’s military operations, who will be talking to his Pakistani counterpart on Monday, said India’s armed forces struck nine militant infrastructure and training facilities, including sites of the Lashkar-e-Taiba group that India blames for carrying out major militant strikes in India and the disputed region of Kashmir.\nGhai said at least 35 to 40 Pakistani soldiers were killed in clashes along the Line of Control, the de facto border that divides the disputed Kashmir region between India and Pakistan. Five Indian soldiers were also killed, he said.\nPakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday said his country’s armed forces had killed 40 to 50 Indian soldiers along the Line of Control. The Pakistani military also claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and inflicted heavy losses on Indian military installations by targeting 26 locations in India.\nThe Associated Press couldn’t independently verify the claims made by India and Pakistan.",

    "article": "DAMASCUS, Syria — The remains of 30 people believed to have been killed by the Islamic State terror group have been found in a remote Syrian town in a search led by Qatari search teams and the FBI, according to a statement from Qatar on Monday.\nThe Qatari internal security forces said the FBI had requested the search, and that DNA tests are currently underway to determine the identities of the people. The Qatari agency did not say who the American intelligence and security agency is trying to find.\nDozens of foreigners, including aid workers and journalists, were killed by IS terrorists who had controlled large swaths of Syria and Iraq for half a decade and declared a so-called caliphate. The group lost most of its territory in late 2017 and was declared defeated in 2019.\nSince then, dozens of gravesites and mass graves have been discovered in northern Syria containing remains and bodies of people IS had abducted over the years.\nAmerican-Israeli journalist Steven Sotloff, fellow US journalist James Foley, and humanitarian workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig are among those killed by IS.\nJohn Cantlie, a British correspondent, was abducted alongside Foley in 2012, and was last seen alive in one of the extremist group’s propaganda videos in 2016.\nThe search took place in the town of Dabiq, near Syria’s northern border with Turkey.\nMass graves have also been found in areas previously controlled by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who was ousted in a lightning insurgency in December, ending his family’s half-century rule. For years, the Assads used their notorious security and intelligence agencies to crack down on dissidents, many of whom have gone missing.\nThe United Nations in 2021 estimated that over 130,000 Syrians were taken away and disappeared during the uprising that began in 2011 and descended into a 13-year civil war.\nLast June, a federal United States appeals court upheld the conviction of a British national for his role in a hostage-taking scheme by the Islamic State group that was tied to the abductions of Foley, Sotloff, Mueller, and Kassig.",

    "date": "Updated 12:41 PM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "ANKARA, Turkey — The PKK Kurdish militant group announced Monday that it will disband and disarm as part of a new peace initiative with Turkey, ending four decades of armed conflict.\nThe decision by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which promises to put an end to one of the longest insurgencies in the Middle East and could have a significant impact in Turkey, Syria, and Iraq, was announced by the Firat News Agency, a media outlet close to the group. It comes days after the PKK convened a party congress in northern Iraq.\n“The 12th PKK Congress has decided to dissolve the PKK’s organizational structure and end its method of armed struggle,” the group announced in a statement after holding its congress last week.\nThe PKK’s decision will give President Tayyip Erdogan the opportunity to boost development in the mainly Kurdish southeast, where the insurgency has handicapped the regional economy for decades.\nOmer Celik, spokesperson for Erdogan’s ruling AK Party, said the PKK’s decision to dissolve was an “an important step toward a terror-free Turkey.”\nTurkey’s foreign ministry did not immediately comment on the announcement, which Ankara had been expecting.\nIn February, PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who has been imprisoned on an island near Istanbul since 1999, urged his group to convene a congress and formally decide to disband, marking a pivotal step toward ending the decades-long conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives since the 1980s.\nOn March 1, the PKK announced a unilateral ceasefire, but attached conditions, including the creation of a legal framework for peace negotiations.\nThe conflict between Turkey and the PKK has spilled over into northern Iraq and northern Syria. It is listed as a terror group by Turkey and its Western allies.\nThe PKK announcement suggested that its armed struggle has successfully challenged policies that sought to suppress Kurdish rights.\nThe congress assessed that the PKK’s struggle had “brought the Kurdish issue to the point of resolution through democratic politics, thus completing its historical mission,” according to the statement.\n“As a result, activities carried out under the name ‘PKK’ were formally terminated,” the statement said.\nDetails of the peace initiative have not been made public, and it was not clear how the process would proceed, including how weapons would be disposed of and who would monitor the procedures.\nThe future of PKK fighters remains uncertain, including whether they may be relocated to third countries. Any concessions the PKK might obtain in exchange for its decision to disband have not been disclosed.\nPrevious peace efforts between Turkey and the group — most recently in 2015 — have ended with failure.\nThe announcement by the PKK comes against a backdrop of major changes in the region, including the coming to power of a new administration in Syria, the weakening of the Hezbollah terror movement in Lebanon, and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza started by the Palestinian terror group’s devastating October 7, 2023, invasion of southern Israel.\nIn recent years, the PKK has been limited to isolated attacks inside Turkey as the Turkish military, backed by armed drones, has pushed PKK insurgents increasingly across the mountainous border into Iraq.\nThe latest peace initiative was launched in October by Erdogan’s coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli, a far-right politician who suggested that Ocalan could be granted parole if his group renounces violence and disbands.\nIn a speech on Saturday, Erdogan hinted that news about a dissolution could come at any moment, adding that his government was determined to “save our country from the scourge of terrorism.”\n“We are advancing with firm steps on the path to the goal of a terror-free Turkey,” he said.\nThe PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, has waged an insurgency since 1984.\nIts original aim was to carve out a homeland for Kurds, who make up about 20 percent of Turkey’s 85 million people.\nSince Ocalan was jailed, there have been various attempts to end the bloodshed, which has cost more than 40,000 lives.",

    "date": "Updated 12:40 PM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "Germany’s Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Sunday that the conflict in Gaza cannot be solved by military means and a political solution must be found to end the war permanently, while visiting Israel to mark 60 years of bilateral relations.\n“I do not believe that this conflict can be permanently resolved by military means,” Wadephul said in Jerusalem. “Nevertheless, it is urgently necessary that Hamas is disarmed and that it can no longer have military control over Gaza.”\nHe said Germany would do whatever it took to guarantee Israel’s security, but this did not mean that his country could not criticize Israel’s actions. He added, though, that this “must not lead to antisemitism.”\n“I am not sure whether all of Israel’s strategic goals can be achieved in this way [through a military campaign] and whether this will serve Israel’s security in the long term,” Wadephul said. “That is why we are appealing for a return to serious negotiations on a ceasefire.”\nWadephul declared that the return of hostages held by terrorists in Gaza is the German government’s priority.\nHe also said it was clear that Gaza was Palestinian territory. “We need a political solution for the reconstruction of Gaza without Hamas,” Wadephul said.\nThe war against Hamas in Gaza, sparked by the terror group’s October 7, 2023, massacre in Israel, has cast a shadow over relations, with Germany at pains to carefully calibrate its response.\nNew German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said last Tuesday, the day he took power, “Israel has the right to defend itself against the brutal attack by Hamas terrorists on October 7 and everything that followed.”\n“But Israel must also remain a country that lives up to its humanitarian obligations, especially as this terrible war is raging in the Gaza Strip, where this confrontation with Hamas terrorists is necessarily taking place,” he said.\nDuring his visit on Sunday, Wadephul met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as his counterpart, Gideon Sa’ar. Berlin’s top diplomat toured Israel’s Arrow missile defense system at the Defense Ministry’s Directorate of Defense, Research and Development, and Yad Vashem Holocaust museum with Sa’ar, who said he had been invited to visit his counterpart in Berlin and “will have the honor of visiting Germany very soon, hopefully in the beginning of June.”\n“We’ve had excellent relations, we’ll continue them in this conversation,” Netanyahu said, alongside Wadephul ahead of their meeting at the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem, in a video shared by the PMO.\n“We have a lot of common interests, a lot of common values, and a lot of common challenges…I will send my best regards to Friedrich Merz and to your joint efforts to continue the Israel–Germany alliance,” he continued.\nWadephul replied, “It’s a privilege to be here on the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries.”\nAlongside Wadephul’s visit, President Isaac Herzog is visiting Germany to mark the milestone in ties.\nIn 1952, Israel and West Germany signed a reparations agreement to help Jerusalem fund the cost of resettling Jewish Holocaust refugees as well as compensating them for the loss of property under the Nazi regime. However, it wasn’t until 1965 that full diplomatic relations were formed. East Germany never maintained full relations with Jerusalem.\nIn his first phone call to the premier since assuming office Thursday, Merz discussed Gaza and regional issues with Netanyahu, and also “reiterated that the existence and security of Israel are a part of German raison d’être,” according to a Berlin readout.\nStanding alongside Wadephul at a press conference in Jerusalem, Sa’ar said Iran’s uranium enrichment facilities “must be dismantled” and that the US and Israel agree on this issue. Next to Sa’ar, Wadephul said, “Iran is an issue that greatly concerns” Germany.\n“The most dangerous regime must not be allowed to obtain the world’s most dangerous weapon. Its uranium enrichment facilities must be dismantled,” said Sa’ar at the Foreign Ministry.",

    "article": "Hundreds of fans gathered outside the Tottenham Hotspur soccer team’s home stadium on Sunday to welcome released hostage and lifelong fan Emily Damari as she arrived to attend a game.\n“I am very happy to be here,” Damari said in her first public appearance in the UK since her release on January 19.\n“Thank you to everyone for praying for me, and shouting my name without knowing me, I don’t really have the words to say how thankful I am for that,” she told the crowd. “All of you are amazing.

    "date": "Updated 11:41 AM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "Families of the hostages were torn early Monday between joy at the announced coming release of US-Israeli Edan Alexander from captivity in the Gaza Strip and anxiety over the continued plight of their own loved ones still held by terror groups in the Palestinian territory. The Israeli government was also widely panned for being sidelined in the talks to secure Alexander’s release.\nThe US and Hamas both confirmed late Sunday that the terror group would release Alexander in what was described as a goodwill gesture to US President Donald Trump ahead of his visit to the region this week.\nIsrael, which sources said was not involved in talks for the release, claimed Monday the development was the result of its military pressure on Hamas, while opposition lawmakers and families of hostages panned the government for not having been a party to talks, for not pursuing a broad deal to bring all of the remaining hostages home, and for allowing negotiations to take place that apparently favored hostages with dual citizenship.\nAlexander, a dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, was serving in the Israel Defense Forces at the time of his abduction. He was kidnapped from his base during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led onslaught that started the war in Gaza. It was not immediately clear when he would be released, but some reports suggested it could be as early as Monday.\nAlexander’s parents flew to Israel with US hostage envoy Adam Boehler on Sunday night in order to arrive in time for their son’s release.\nA statement on behalf of the Alexanders said that they are in constant contact with the US government and that “no hostage should be left behind.”\nThe family of hostage Alon Ohel on Monday criticized the planned release of Alexander while leaving the rest of the hostages behind, noting that their son is continuing to suffer in captivity.\n“The deal leaves Alon behind while he is injured and in pain,” the family said in a statement carried by Hebrew media. “We are in a nightmare and frightened.”\nThe comments reflected a sense of unease among some hostages’ families that the arrangement securing Alexander’s release, which the US says is part of an effort to end the war and free all hostages, differentiates between those in Gaza based on what passports they hold. Ohel’s mother Idit has been particularly vocal against what she terms a form of selection between hostages during previous rounds of releases.\nAccording to the family, relying on information from freed hostages, Ohel has been kept bound in chains and received no medical attention for shrapnel in his eye and shoulder from wounds suffered on October 7, 2023.\n“With a broken heart,” the family’s statement offered good wishes to the Alexander family on their son’s impending freedom and urged Israel’s government to reach a deal securing the release of the rest of the hostages.\n“Alon and the rest of the injured hostages are being left behind in the tunnels with no medical attention or help,” the family said. “There is no date for the end of our nightmare.”\nEinav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, said in a statement that her son was held with Alexander.\n“The two of them are in a dark tunnel without any other hostages. If Matan is left alone in the tunnel, Netanyahu is deciding to murder my boy; instead of releasing all of the hostages, he has become my private angel of death.”\nZangauker, whose combative criticism of the government has made her a prominent activist on behalf of the hostages, vowed to “hunt down the prime minister” for the suffering caused to her son.\nThe family of Itay Chen, a dual US-Israeli citizen whose body is held in Gaza, said in a statement, “These are moments of mixed feelings. We rejoice in the joy of Yael and Adi Alexander, who will soon get to hug their son. Every hostage that comes home warms the hearts of the families of hostages. On the other hand, our hearts cannot bear the deep grief. It is possible, and necessary, to bring everyone back.”\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the main group representing hostage families, said in a statement Sunday that the release of Alexander “must be the start of a single agreement that will return all 59 [remaining] hostages.”\n“There is only one moral, proper, and necessary agreement: the immediate return of all the hostages and the end of the war,” said the forum, which has long been calling for the government to agree to a deal that will return all the remaining hostages at once, rather than in phases.\n“Now is the time to bring about a breakthrough in negotiations. The responsibility lies with the Israeli government,” it added. “Nobody can be left behind.”\nOn Monday, the forum announced a rally to be held at noon in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv in anticipation of Alexander’s release.\nIn a post to X, Opposition Leader Yair Lapid said that Alexander’s release “must lead to a broad hostage deal that will return home all the hostages. They have no time.”\nHe further said that reports of direct contact between the US and Hamas to reach the agreement “are a disgraceful failure of diplomacy by the Israeli government and the person who heads it. The hostages are ours, and the responsibility to return them is of the government.”\nOpposition MK Benny Gantz, leader of the National Unity Party, posted that “the heart swells at the apparent return of Edan — the stomach turns to see how the Israeli government is absent from every initiative to take responsibility.”\n“The time has come for the prime minister to exercise that responsibility,” he wrote.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel has committed to facilitating a safe corridor for the return of Alexander.\nIn a statement, the Prime Minister’s Office said Jerusalem has, however, made no further promise for a ceasefire or for the release of Palestinian security prisoners, who have been exchanged for hostages in previous deals.\n“The expected release of IDF soldier Edan Alexander [by Hamas] without getting anything in return, will be possible thanks to the determined policy we led, with the backing of [US] President [Donald] Trump, and thanks to IDF troops’ military pressure in the Gaza Strip,” the PMO said.\n“We are in critical days in which Hamas is facing a deal that would enable our hostages’ release,” it added. “Negotiations will continue under fire and amidst preparations for the intensification of the fighting.”\nEarlier, the PMO confirmed that the US informed Israel that Hamas will release hostage Alexander “without any compensation or conditions” as a gesture of goodwill to the US.\nAn Israeli official claimed in an anonymous statement to reporters that Alexander’s imminent release was secured thanks to Israel’s military pressure on Hamas.\n“Hamas understood it must make a gesture to the Americans because this is the only way for it to try to prevent the expansion of the war,” the official said.\nAppearing to respond to criticism from hostage families and the opposition that Alexander was being freed solely due to his American nationality, the official added: “Thanks to the military pressure, Hamas agreed thus far to release most of our hostages, regardless of foreign passports. We will continue to do everything to return all of our hostages.”\nThe official said Israel will facilitate a safe corridor to get Alexander out of Gaza — presumably meaning halting fighting and reconnaissance flights in certain areas — but stressed that there is no ceasefire and that Hamas isn’t getting anything in return for the release. If Hamas agrees to an Israel-accepted proposal for a wider hostage deal, the expansion of the war will be postponed, the official added.\nTerror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 59 hostages, including 58 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF. The Hamas attack also killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians.\nHamas released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire between January and March. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. In exchange, Israel has freed some 2,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners, and Gazan terror suspects detained during the war.\nEight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.\nThe body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas, and is counted among the 59 hostages.",

    "article": "DAMASCUS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) — A Trump Tower in Damascus, a detente with Israel and US access to Syria’s oil and gas are part of Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa’s strategic pitch to try to get face time with US President Donald Trump during his trip to the Middle East, according to several sources familiar with the push to woo Washington.\nJonathan Bass, an American pro-Trump activist who on April 30 met Sharaa for four hours in Damascus, along with Syrian activists and Gulf Arab states has been trying to arrange a landmark — if highly unlikely — meeting between the two leaders this week on the sidelines of Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\nSyria has struggled to implement conditions set out by Washington for relief from US sanctions, which keep the country cut off from the global financial system and make economic recovery extremely challenging after 14 years of grinding war.\nBass hopes that getting Trump into a room with Sharaa, who still remains a US-designated terrorist over his al-Qaeda past, could help soften the Republican president and his administration’s thinking on Damascus and cool an increasingly tense relationship between Syria and Israel.\nPart of the bet for the effort is based on Trump’s history of breaking with longstanding US foreign policy taboos, such as when he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea in 2019.\n“Sharaa wants a business deal for the future of his country,” Bass said, noting it could cover energy exploitation, cooperation against Iran and engagement with Israel.\n“He told me he wants a Trump Tower in Damascus. He wants peace with his neighbors. What he told me is good for the region, good for Israel,” said Bass.\nSharaa also shared what he saw as a personal connection with Trump: both have been shot at, narrowly surviving attempts on their lives, Bass said.\nSyrian officials and a presidency media official did not respond to a request for comment.\nSharaa spoke with Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Sunday, according to the Syrian presidency.\nA person close to Sharaa said afterwards a Trump-Sharaa meeting remained possible in Saudi Arabia, but would not confirm whether Sharaa had received an invitation.\n“Whether or not the meeting takes place won’t be known until the last moment,” the person said.\nTo be clear, a Trump-Sharaa meeting during the US president’s visit to the region is widely seen as unlikely, given Trump’s packed schedule, his priorities and lack of consensus within Trump’s team on how to tackle Syria.\nA source familiar with ongoing efforts said a high-level Syria-US meeting was set to take place in the region during the week of Trump’s visit, but that it would not be between Trump and Sharaa.\n“There is definitely a push underway,” said Charles Lister, head of the Syria Initiative at the Middle East Institute.\n“The idea is that getting to Trump directly is the best avenue because there are just too many ideologues within the administration to get past.”\nWashington is yet to formulate and articulate a coherent Syria policy, but the administration has increasingly been viewing relations with Damascus from a perspective of counterterrorism, three sources including a US official familiar with the policy-making said.\nThat approach was illustrated by the make-up of the US delegation in a meeting last month between Washington and Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani in New York, which included a senior counterterrorism official from the State Department, two of the sources said.\nUS officials conveyed to Shibani that Washington found steps taken by Damascus to be insufficient, particularly on the US demand to remove foreign fighters from senior posts in the army and expel as many of them as possible, the sources said.\nThe US Treasury has since conveyed its own demands on the Syrian government, bringing the number of conditions to more than a dozen, one of the sources said.\nThe US State Department declined to disclose who attended the meeting from the US side and said it does not comment on private diplomatic discussions.\nWhite House National Security Council spokesperson James Hewitt said the actions of Syria’s interim authorities would determine the future US support or possible sanctions relief.\nA key aim of Syria’s overtures to Washington is communicating that it poses no threat to Israel, which has escalated airstrikes in Syria since the country’s rebels-turned rulers ousted former strongman Bashar al-Assad last year.\nIsrael says the strikes were largely aimed at destroying Syria’s military and chemical arsenal to stop them falling into the hands of the new regime.\nIsrael’s ground forces have also occupied a buffer zone in southwestern Syria along the border, while the government has lobbied the US to keep Syria decentralized and isolated.\nThe IDF described its presence in southern Syria’s buffer zone as a temporary and defensive measure, though Defense Minister Israel Katz has said that troops will remain deployed to nine army posts in the area “indefinitely.”\nIsrael has also said it aims to protect Syrian minority groups. Sectarian violence in Syria has escalated in recent weeks, as Islamist supporters of the country’s new regime have targeted Druze communities in clashes in southern Syria. Reports have put the death toll from the fighting at around 100.\nIsrael has vowed to protect the Syrian Druze community from threats, and the IDF has struck targets in the country as a “warning” to the new regime.\nSyria’s government has condemned Israel’s strikes as escalatory and as foreign interference, and says the new government in Damascus is working to unify the country after 14 years of civil war.\nSharaa last week confirmed indirect negotiations with Israel aimed at calming tensions, after Reuters reported that such talks had occurred via the UAE.\nIn a separate effort, Bass said Sharaa told him to pass messages between Syria and Israel that may have led to a direct meeting between Israeli and Syrian officials.\nBut Israel soon resumed strikes, including one near the presidential palace, which it framed as a message to Syria’s rulers to protect the country’s Druze minority amid clashes with Sunni militants.\n“Sharaa sent the Israelis an olive branch. Israel sent missiles,” Bass said.\n“We need Trump to help sort this relationship out.”\nTimes of Israel staff contributed to this report.",

    "date": "Updated 09:52 AM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday rejected reports of widening gaps between him and US President Donald Trump, and said that his relationship with the president was “excellent” in a video update on his X account.\nThe reports came ahead of Trump’s trip to the Middle East this week, in which the US president will skip Israel but will stop in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, leading government critics to warn Israel was being left out of Washington’s regional diplomatic initiatives.\n“What can I say — it’s not Trump saying it and it’s not me saying it,” Netanyahu said, when asked about sources in the media claiming there is growing tension between Washington and Jerusalem amid the war in Gaza and the US-Iran nuclear talks.\n“It was his [Trump’s] spokesperson at the White House who said: ‘What is this nonsense?’” Netanyahu continued, referring to recent comments from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. “She said the relationship is excellent, and I’m telling you — the relationship is excellent.”\n“These spins — most of them are born here [in Israel.] They’re born in a certain media outlet that’s trying to promote a certain candidate. And in order to promote him, they need to say: ‘Trump and Netanyahu are no longer,’” the premier claimed.\nHe did not name the media outlet.\n“I speak to him [Trump] from time to time. I won’t say every couple of days, but every two or three weeks, I talk to him. My people are in the White House — including just two to three days ago, they were there…We are currently blessed with a president and an administration that is very, very friendly. And we’re trying to coordinate both the big things as well as the small things,” concluded Netanyahu, referring to a visit last week to the White House by Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer.\nUS Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff added his voice to the growing chorus of officials denying any tensions between the two leaders, in an interview with the right-wing Breitbart news site conducted last week and published Sunday evening.\n“Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli people are a staunch ally of the United States, and it goes back the other way,” said Witkoff. “I’ve been at multiple meetings with the president and the prime minister—they’re friendly. They’re good friends, in fact.”\nHe said this does not mean they see eye-to-eye “on absolutely everything,” but that the media “hears about a small disagreement… then conflates that into some large article about massive issues that they have.”\n“Israel is a great partner for the United States, strategically, economically. We think very much alike, we have very similar objectives,” the US envoy said. “They don’t want to see a weaponized nuclear state in the state of Iran. And so, I don’t think there’s much daylight between how they think and how we think from a foreign policy perspective.”\nChannel 12 reported Sunday that Witkoff recently told hostages’ families that he disagrees with Israel’s approach to the war in the Strip, and believes that Israel is pointlessly extending the war when reaching a new ceasefire and hostage release deal is the correct next step to take.\nIsrael is planning to launch a major military offensive against Hamas in Gaza if no hostage deal is reached with the terror group by the end of Trump’s visit to the region.\nChannel 12 cited the families as saying they had not heard this kind of criticism of Israeli government policy from Witkoff in the past.\nFormer US ambassador to Israel David Friedman, who served under the first Trump administration, also asserted in an X post, “There is NO RIFT between President Trump and PM Netanyahu. There are those in both the US and Israel who would like to see such a rift, and they are feeding false accounts to the media to achieve just that. But it’s all fake.”\nCurrent US Ambassador Mike Huckabee tried to quell the rumors of tensions in interviews with Israeli networks Saturday, asserting that the US president was not snubbing Israel by skipping the Jewish state during his upcoming visit.\nJerusalem is reportedly unhappy with the ongoing US-Iran talks, which are said to be developing into a largely similar framework to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, which was signed by then-US president Barack Obama and was panned at the time by Netanyahu as disastrous for Israel.\nUnder the terms being discussed, according to reports, Iran would limit stockpile size and centrifuge types, and dilute, export, or seal its 60 percent uranium stock under unprecedented International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) scrutiny, in exchange for substantial sanctions relief.\nThis approach has not aligned with Netanyahu’s longtime position, which is that Israel will not allow Iran to attain nuclear weapons and is opposed to any talks that don’t lead Iran to agree to a “Libya-style agreement,” under which Tehran’s entire nuclear program — both military and civilian — would be dismantled completely.\nIn addition, Israel had not been made aware in advance of a recent deal signed between the US and the Houthi rebels in Yemen regarding a cessation of US bombing if the Iran-backed rebels stop firing on US shipping, which notably left the door open for Houthi strikes on Israel to go unabated.\nThat deal was announced by Trump two days after a Houthi missile impacted the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, a few hundred yards from the main control tower, lightly injuring several people and prompting most foreign airlines to halt flights to Israel.\nIsrael’s Channel 13 reported Sunday evening that people in Netanyahu’s inner circle have expressed unusually harsh criticism toward the Trump administration in recent weeks.\n“There’s chaos in the Trump administration — the right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing,” said a senior figure close to the premier, according to the report.\n“It’s not even clear if this has anything to do with us. Everything operates according to the president’s whims. Sometimes that works in our favor, and sometimes it doesn’t,” the source said.\nThe premier’s office also expressed disappointment in the White House through Dermer, during a meeting last Thursday between the top Netanyahu adviser and Trump, the report added.\nIn the US, Fox News also reported on the rift, citing analysts as saying Netanyahu stood as a “roadblock” to Trump’s diplomatic initiatives in the region, adding that Israel was not part of securing the expected release of US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, who was kidnapped during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led onslaught that started the war in Gaza.\nOfficials told The Times of Israel the move was a goodwill gesture by Hamas ahead of Trump’s Middle East visit, hoping that he will coax Israel to sign a deal freeing the remaining hostages in exchange for an end to the war.",

    "article": "The Palestinian Authority has stopped paying stipends to at least 1,612 Palestinian security prisoners in Israeli jails, two Palestinian sources told The Times of Israel on Sunday, as Ramallah appeared to move forward with a reform of its controversial welfare system.\nIn February, PA President Mahmoud Abbas signed a decree canceling legislation that established the old system, which included payments to the families of slain terrorists and the families of security prisoners held in Israeli jails, based on the length of their sentence.\nThe decree also established a new non-governmental body that was tasked with providing welfare payments strictly based on economic need. Palestinians — including the families of prisoners and slain attackers — will be able to apply for welfare stipends, and bureaucrats will adjudicate whether each applicant will receive payments and how much based on economic criteria, Palestinian and US officials have told The Times of Israel.\nThe transition to the new system has taken time, but last month, senior Palestinian official Hussein al-Sheikh — who has since been formally appointed Abbas’s deputy — penned a letter to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio inviting the Trump administration to send a delegation to Ramallah from June 1 onward in order to certify that the PA has implemented the reform and is in compliance with US legislation that bars American aid that directly benefits the PA so long as its previous prisoner payment system remained in place.\nPalestinian sources told The Times of Israel in March and April that families of prisoners and slain attackers were still receiving stipends based on the old system, as the new system was not in place. But that is no longer the case for at least 1,612 prisoners, who did not receive a stipend for the month of May, the two sources said.\nThe sources did not know what that meant for the thousands of other prisoners and could not elaborate further on the figure.\nCritics argued that the old policy incentivized terror and dubbed it “pay-to-slay.” Palestinian leaders have long defended the stipends, describing them as a form of social welfare and necessary compensation for victims of what they said is Israel’s callous military justice system in the West Bank.\nThough the PA’s reform was largely finalized under the Biden administration, Ramallah decided to hold off on announcing the move, preferring to save it as a goodwill gesture for the incoming Trump administration.",

    "date": "Updated 07:36 AM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "A third-party mediator operated a backchannel between the United States and Hamas that helped secure the agreement to release American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, a source familiar with the matter and a Palestinian official revealed to The Times of Israel on Sunday.\nThe backchannel was operated by a non-governmental individual who passed along messages between Hamas’s leadership in Qatar and US special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, the sources said, while declining to reveal the identity of the person on the record.\nThe backchannel was opened last month, with the person urging Hamas to release Alexander unconditionally, telling the terror group that the move would go a long way with the Trump administration and potentially open the door to Washington coaxing Israel to agree to a deal that would bring about an end to the war in Gaza in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages — a trade Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has until now rejected, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power.\nHamas for weeks pushed back against freeing Alexander unconditionally and presented the third-party backchannel with proposals that would have seen Israel take various steps in exchange for the 21-year-old’s release.\nThe go-between warned Hamas last week that such offers wouldn’t fly and that time was not on the group’s side, with Israel planning to launch a major operation to gradually re-occupy the entire Gaza Strip once US President Donald Trump wraps up his trip to the region on Friday. Trump will depart on Monday for Saudi Arabia before making stops in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. He is not slated to visit Israel on this trip.\nOver the weekend, Hamas informed the go-between that it had agreed to release Alexander unconditionally but wanted Witkoff to know that the step should not be viewed as a one-off, the sources said. Hamas stressed to the mediator that it was ready to work with the Trump administration to secure a permanent ceasefire in Gaza with security arrangements in order to ensure a yearslong calm until a final settlement of the conflict is reached, the sources said.\nHamas also told the US via the backchannel that it needed to locate Alexander. Last month, it released a propaganda video showing Alexander alive. Two days later, the group claimed it had lost contact with his captors after an Israeli airstrike.\nOn Sunday, Hamas told the mediator that it had found Alexander and was prepared to move ahead with his release. The negotiator, in turn told Hamas to inform Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani of the decision. The Qatari premier then called Witkoff to confirm that Alexander’s release would be moving ahead.\nWitkoff then called Netanyahu and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to inform them of the development, the US official said. Israel then agreed to temporary halt some of its military operations, including drone surveillance of the Strip in the lead-up and during Alexander’s release on Monday, the source familiar with the matter said.\nAfter receiving the news from Witkoff, Alexander’s parents took off for Israel from the US on Sunday night and were accompanied by US hostage envoy Adam Boehler.\nNetanyahu’s office issued a statement early Monday morning claiming that Alexander’s release was made possible due to Israel’s military pressure in Gaza. It stressed that Israel did not agree to a ceasefire or to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Alexander — only to provide a safe corridor to allow for his release.\nIn an earlier statement attributed to an “Israeli official,” Netanyahu’s office said that it was still prepared to accept the so-called “Witkoff proposal” through which Hamas agrees to release half of the hostages up front in exchange for a weekslong truce during which the sides agree to hold talks on the terms of a permanent end to the war.\nSuch talks were supposed to have been held during the previous agreement that the sides signed in January, but Netanyahu largely refused to engage in such negotiations, amid pressure from his far-right coalition partners who threatened to collapse his government if he agreed to end the war.\nAccordingly, Hamas has insisted on ironclad guarantees, such as a UN Security Council resolution, in order to ensure that Israel holds those talks and agrees to end the war.\nIn addition to releasing the hostages, Israel is demanding that Hamas dismantle its governing and military capabilities. While the group has said it is prepared to forgo control of the Strip to an independent committee of Palestinian technocrats, it has held off on the demand to permanently disarm.",

    "article": "US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff recently told families of hostages held in Gaza that he disagrees with Israel’s approach to the war in the Strip, and believes reaching a new ceasefire and hostage release deal is the correct next step to take, a report said Sunday, as reports of the growing rift between the US and Israeli leaders mount.\nAccording to Channel 12, Witkoff told the families that the US “wants to return the hostages, but Israel is not ready to end the war.”\n“Israel is prolonging the war, even though we do not see where further progress can be made,” Witkoff said, according to the report, which cited sources who attended the meeting.\n“Still, there is currently a window of opportunity that we hope Israel and all the mediators will take advantage of. We are putting pressure on all the mediators and doing everything to return the hostages,” he reportedly said.\nChannel 12 cited the families as saying they’ve not heard this kind of criticism of Israeli government policy from Witkoff in the past.\nThe report also quoted unnamed senior Israeli officials as issuing a warning: “If there are no agreements by the end of [US President Donald] Trump’s visit to the Middle East, Israel will launch a ground operation and it will take several weeks until the next ‘exit point.’ Once we have begun the intensified operation, we won’t agree to quickly halt it. Hamas will not determine the timeline.”\nEchoing Witkoff’s reported remarks, however, the officials agreed that there was currently “a window of opportunity,” and stated that the mediators have an obligation to make this clear to Hamas, according to Channel 12.\nThe report said Israel was open to various proposals — including what it said Israel is calling a “watered-down Witkoff proposal” — but that if Hamas continues its refusal to agree to a deal, there is “no alternative” to an intensified operation that will not end quickly. What Israel has referred to as the “Witkoff proposal” — which sources told The Times of Israel at the time is in fact more of an Israeli offer — provides for the release of around half of the living hostages in return for an extended truce, followed by the release of the rest of the hostages alongside an end to the war.\nThe network said Witkoff was holding conversations with various key players Sunday night, trying to establish some kind of framework for a deal this week.\nWalla news reported that Witkoff was currently holding talks with Hamas, Qatar, Egypt and Israel on a hostage deal and longer-term calm.\nAfter these reports, the Hamas terror group announced Sunday evening that it would release American-Israeli hostage soldier Edan Alexander, believed to be the last remaining living US citizen held hostage in Gaza, and one of 59 total captives still held by Palestinian terror groups.\nAlexander was taken captive from his tank during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, during which terrorists killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages back to the Strip, sparking the ongoing war. He has been held in Gaza for over 580 days.\nThe Hamas statement, issued ahead of Trump’s trip to the region this week, was meant as a goodwill gesture in the hope that Washington will coax Israel to end the war in Gaza, a source involved in the mediation effort told The Times of Israel.\nThe source said Hamas has received assurances from the US through mediators that Alexander’s release “would go a long way” with Trump, who wants to see the remaining hostages released and for the war in Gaza to end.\nIt was unclear when Alexander would be released, but a source involved in the process told The Times of Israel that the goal was for him to be released early this week, potentially as early as Monday.\nAccording to a source familiar with the negotiations, the US did not brief Israel on the effort to release Alexander until after the deal with Hamas was reached, saying Israel had generally been aware that efforts were ongoing, but only knew about them from its own intelligence operations.\nAccording to a separate Sunday report, Trump and Netanyahu are increasingly at odds with one another over their contrasting visions for the Middle East, and in particular for the Gaza Strip.\nCiting unnamed US officials, NBC reported that Trump is opposed to Netanyahu’s plans for a new, significantly expanded operation in the Gaza Strip, and has privately called it a wasted effort that will interfere with his vision to rebuild the enclave.\nNetanyahu, meanwhile, was said to be growing increasingly frustrated with the US approach to Iran amid the nuclear talks and after Washington struck a deal with the Houthis, agreeing to end its intensive bombing campaign in return for an end to the Iran-backed group’s maritime attacks.\nSpeaking to NBC, one US official said Israel was “worried about any deal” that the US could sign with Iran to thwart its nuclear ambitions.\nTo that end, two US officials said Netanyahu has privately dismissed the negotiations as a waste of time, arguing that even if a deal is forged, Tehran would inevitably break it.\nIsrael would rather take action and strike Iran’s nuclear facilities, the report said, and believes that the opportunity to do so is shrinking further the longer talks continue.\nJerusalem is reportedly unhappy with the ongoing US-Iran talks, which are said to be developing into a largely similar framework to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, which was signed by then-US president Barack Obama and was panned at the time by Netanyahu as disastrous for Israel.\nUnder the terms being discussed, according to reports, Iran would limit stockpile size and centrifuge types, and dilute, export or seal its 60 percent uranium stock under unprecedented International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) scrutiny, in exchange for substantial sanctions relief.\nThis approach has not aligned with Netanyahu’s longtime position, which is that Israel will not allow Iran to attain nuclear weapons and is opposed to any talks that don’t lead Iran to agree to a “Libya-style agreement,” under which Tehran’s entire nuclear program — both military and civilian — would be dismantled completely.\nAnother report on Sunday, this time on Channel 13, said that officials in Netanyahu’s entourage have become increasingly vocal against the Trump administration’s recent decisions regarding the Middle East.\n“There is chaos in the Trump administration, the right foot doesn’t know what the left foot is doing,” a senior official close to the premier said, according to the report. “I’m not sure it has anything to do with us at all. Everything works according to the president’s whims. Sometimes it works in our favor and sometimes it doesn’t.”\nAfter the flurry of reports that the two leaders were at odds, Netanyahu took to social media to set the record straight, saying that his bond with Trump was “excellent.”\n“What can I say — it’s not Trump saying it and it’s not me saying it,” Netanyahu said in a video update on his X account, adding that “the relationship is excellent.”\n“I speak to him [Trump] from time to time.

    "article": "Hamas was set to release American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander on Monday after over 580 days in captivity. The Palestinian terror group agreed to the move as a gesture of goodwill to US President Donald Trump ahead of his trip to the region, hoping that he will in turn coax Israel to sign a deal freeing the remaining hostages in exchange for an end to the war, a US official, a Palestinian official and a third source familiar with the matter told The Times of Israel on Sunday.\nUS special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff called Alexander’s parents Yael and Adi on Sunday afternoon to inform them of the news, a US official said. The Alexanders flew to Israel with US hostage envoy Adam Boehler on Sunday night in order to arrive in time for Alexander’s release. Witkoff was slated to fly to Israel separately from Oman, where he held the fourth round of nuclear talks with Iran on Sunday.\n“The entire family is now on the way to Israel,” Edan’s father, Adi, told the Ynet news site. “We were completely surprised to receive the call from Witkoff. We knew about the negotiations but not about such a dramatic development.”\nBoehler himself tweeted that the news of Alexander’s release was a positive step forward, adding: “We would also ask that Hamas release the bodies of four other Americans that were taken.”\nThe bodies of slain hostages Itay Chen, Omer Neutra, Gadi Haggai and Judith Weinstein Haggai are among the 59 captives still held by Hamas. Up to 24 of those hostages are believed to still be alive.\nHamas has said it is willing to release all of the hostages at once in exchange for an end to the war, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused such an exchange, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power.\nHamas is hoping that releasing Alexander will be enough to convince Trump to push Netanyahu to accept the trade, the source familiar with the matter said.\nThe source added that Hamas was assured by a mediator that Alexander’s release “would go a long way” with Trump, who wants to see the remaining hostages released and for the war in Gaza to end.\nCertain security measures need to be taken in order for the release to move forward, such as Israel halting military operations and drone surveillance of parts of the Strip, as it has had to do in previous releases, a source involved in the process told The Times of Israel.\nAlexander, a dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, was serving in the Israel Defense Forces at the time of his abduction. He was kidnapped from his base during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led onslaught that started the war in Gaza. He is set to be the first male soldier to be released.\nIn a statement, Hamas said the decision to release Alexander came after recent talks with US officials and “intensified efforts to achieve a ceasefire, open border crossings, and allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.”\nOn this Mother’s Day, it is my honor to travel with Edan Alexander’s mom Yael for reunion of her son from Hamas.\nThank you President Trump for your commitment to bringing all Americans home. @POTUS @SecRubio  @SteveWitkoff ❤️❤️❤️ pic.twitter.com/UwcehqJ0xB\n— Adam Boehler (@aboehler) May 12, 2025\nIt did not say when Alexander would be released. The officials who spoke with The Times of Israel said that — contrary to Hamas’s claim — no direct talks were held between the terror group and the US.\nHamas in its statement also said that it was prepared to enter intensified negotiations aimed at reaching a final agreement to end the war, establish a mutually “agreed prisoner exchange, and enable Gaza to be administered by an independent professional authority.”\nHamas uses the term “prisoner exchange” to refer to the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian security prisoners, including terrorists convicted of murdering Israelis.\n“This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones,” Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday evening. “Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict. I look very much forward to that day of celebration!”\nMONUMENTAL NEWS: \"I am happy to announce that Edan Alexander, an American citizen who has been held hostage since October 2023, is coming home to his family.\" –President Donald J. Trump ???????? pic.twitter.com/zTFBzD5rBN\n— The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 11, 2025\nQatar and Egypt welcomed the news in a joint statement, calling it “a gesture of goodwill and an encouraging step toward a return to the negotiating table to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, the release of prisoners and detainees, and ensure the safe and unhindered flow of aid to address the tragic conditions in the Strip.”\nThe US did not brief Israel on the effort to release Alexander until after the deal with Hamas was reached, the source familiar with the details of Alexander’s release told The Times of Israel.\nIsrael was generally aware that efforts were ongoing, but only knew about them from its own intelligence operations. On Sunday evening, Witkoff updated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer about the development, the US official said.\nNetanyahu’s office confirmed that the US had informed Israel that Hamas would release Alexander “without any compensation or conditions,” and as a gesture of goodwill to the US.\n“The US conveyed to Israel that this move is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of additional hostages, based on the original Witkoff proposal — which Israel has already accepted,” said the PMO in a statement, referring to a framework that sources have told The Times of Israel was in fact proposed by Israel, under which around half the living hostages would go free in exchange for an extended truce, with the rest being later freed in exchange for an end to the war.\nIsrael was making preparations for the potential release, the PMO continued, adding that “according to Israeli policy, the negotiation will take place under fire, with a firm commitment to achieving all the objectives of the war.”\nEarlier Sunday, multiple reports quoted Netanyahu as telling the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that Hamas could release Alexander during Trump’s visit, and welcomed the possibility, adding: “These are very critical days.”\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement Sunday that the release of Alexander “must be the start of a single agreement that will return all 59 hostages.”\n“There is only one moral, proper and necessary agreement: the immediate return of all the hostages and the end of the war,” said the forum, which has long been calling for the government to agree to a deal that will return all the remaining hostages at once, rather than in phases.\n“Now is the time to bring about a breakthrough in negotiations. The responsibility lies with the Israeli government,” it added. “Nobody can be left behind.”\nTerror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 59 hostages, including 58 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF.\nHamas released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire between January and March. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. In exchange, Israel has freed some 2,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners, and Gazan terror suspects detained during the war.\nEight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.\nThe body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas, and is counted among the 59 hostages.\nAgencies contributed to this report.",

    "subheading": "No immediate reports of Israeli strikes; military calls for civilians to stay away from ports ‘until further notice’",

    "article": "The Israel Defense Forces on Sunday evening issued an “urgent” evacuation warning to the three Houthi-controlled ports in western Yemen, ahead of potential Israeli strikes.\nThe warning came after the Houthis fired several ballistic missiles and drones at Israel in recent days, since the Israeli Air Force struck the Houthi-controlled airport in Sanaa and several other facilities last week in response to a Houthi ballistic missile that impacted inside the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport last Sunday.\nIn a post on X, the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesman Col. Avichay Adraee warned those at the Ras Isa, Hodeidah, and Salif ports on the western coast to evacuate.\n“Due to the Houthi terror regime’s use of ports for its terror activities, we urge all those present at these ports to evacuate and stay away from them for your own safety until further notice,” he said.\nA report by Reuters, citing the Houthi interior ministry, claimed that Israel targeted Hodeidah port following the warning. Israeli military sources said no strikes had been carried out as of Sunday night. There were no reports in Houthi media of strikes either.\nOn Friday afternoon, the Houthis fired a ballistic missile that triggered sirens across central Israel. The IDF reported that the missile was successfully intercepted by air defenses.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz warned then that Israel would respond. “The Houthis continue to launch Iranian missiles at Israel. As we promised, we will respond, strongly in Yemen and anywhere else necessary,” he said in a statement.\nThe Friday attack came three days after the US announced that it had reached a ceasefire with the Yemeni terror group.\nHouthi officials made clear that the deal, in which they agreed to stop targeting US maritime activity in the Red Sea in exchange for an end to weeks of intense US airstrikes, did not include any agreement to stop firing at Israel or ships linked to the Jewish state.\nOn Wednesday, the IDF said a missile fired by the Houthis crashed outside Israeli territory. Earlier in the day, the IDF said it had downed a drone launched from Yemen.\nThe attacks came after Israel carried out two days of heavy sorties targeting infrastructure controlled by the Houthis in response to the missile that struck Ben Gurion Airport. Since Ben Gurion was hit, most foreign airlines have suspended flights to Israel.\nThe fiery reprisals destroyed the international airport in the capital Sanaa, and caused heavy damage to a port in Hodeida and several power stations and a cement factory, officials said.\nThe Houthis — whose slogan calls for “Death to America, Death to Israel, [and] a Curse on the Jews” — first began attacking Israel and maritime traffic in November 2023, a month after the October 7 Hamas massacre.\nThe Houthis held their fire when a ceasefire was reached between Israel and Hamas in January 2025. By that point, they had fired over 40 ballistic missiles and dozens of attack drones and cruise missiles at Israel, including one that killed a civilian and wounded several others in Tel Aviv in July, prompting Israel’s first strike in Yemen.\nSince March 18, when the IDF resumed its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis have launched some 29 ballistic missiles and at least 10 drones at Israel.\nThe sirens warning of missile attacks have sent hundreds of thousands of Israelis rushing to shelters at all hours of the day and night.",

    "article": "Iran and the United States wrapped up nuclear talks in Oman on Sunday with no apparent breakthrough and a public standoff over enrichment, but with both sides confirming plans for future negotiations.\nIt was the fourth round of the talks that began a month ago, marking the highest-level contact between the two foes since Washington withdrew in 2018 from a landmark nuclear deal during President Donald Trump’s first term.\nBoth sides had reported progress in the previous three rounds, and on Sunday, Iran said the meeting was “difficult but useful,” while a senior US official said Washington was “encouraged.”\nIn a post on X, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said the talks could help “better understand each other’s positions and to find reasonable and realistic ways to address the differences.”\nBaqaei earlier said negotiators would push for relief from US sanctions.\nThe US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington was “encouraged by today’s outcome and look(s) forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future,” without specifying when.\nBaqaei said that the “next round will be coordinated and announced by Oman.”\nAccording to the US official, the talks were “both direct and indirect, and lasted over three hours.”\n“Agreement was reached to move forward” and “continue working through technical elements,” the official added.\nIran entered the talks saying that its right to maintain uranium enrichment was “non-negotiable,” while Washington’s chief negotiator Steve Witkoff has said that the American demand to stop enrichment is a “red line.”\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led Tehran’s delegation, said in a video before departing for the Omani capital Muscat that “enrichment capability is one of the honors” of Iran.\nThe talks come amid a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region, with Trump heading to the Gulf for his first major foreign tour next week, and Araghchi just back from Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\nThe fourth round that took place on Sunday was initially scheduled for May 3, but was delayed, with mediator Oman citing “logistical reasons.”\nYousuf Al Bulushi, chairman of the Muscat Policy Council think tank, said that a breakthrough “will take quite some time, but I’m optimistic.”\nHe warned, however, that both sides had lost precious time during past negotiations, trying to clarify public statements “instead of focusing solely on talks.”\nPublic pressure “is a tactic in negotiations… but this is really impacting the atmosphere” at the table, said Bulushi.\nWestern countries, including the United States, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, while Tehran insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.\nIran currently enriches uranium to 60-percent purity — far above the 3.67% limit set in the 2015 deal with the United States and other world powers, and a short technical step from the 90% needed for weapons-grade material. Tehran regularly threatens to destroy Israel, and its uranium enrichment level is far higher than necessary for civilian uses.\nWitkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy, said in a Friday interview that Iran’s “enrichment facilities have to be dismantled.”\n“That’s our red line. No enrichment. That means dismantlement. It means no weaponization. And it means that Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan — those are their three enrichment facilities — have to be dismantled,” he told US right-wing outlet Breitbart News, after initially suggesting flexibility on Tehran maintaining low-level enrichment of uranium for civilian purposes.\nAraghchi has repeatedly defended Iran’s right to enrich uranium.\nAt a press conference in Jerusalem on Sunday, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said Iran’s uranium enrichment facilities “must be dismantled,” and that the US and Israel agree on this issue.\n“The most dangerous regime must not be allowed to obtain the world’s most dangerous weapon,” he said.\nSa’ar said he “agrees very much” with comments made over the weekend by Witkoff, who said enrichment facilities “have to be dismantled” for Washington to take it at its word that it does not want nuclear arms.\n“I think this is the right approach and we hold the same view on the matter,” Sa’ar said.\nAsked whether Israel is concerned about recent foreign policy moves by Trump that seemed to sideline Jerusalem on key regional issues, Sa’ar said, “We are coordinated. It doesn’t mean we must fully agree one hundred percent on every issue.”\n“The US is a sovereign state, Israel is a sovereign state. But I believe that we have very, very big common grounds with positions in this US administration, more than in the past…I think the US is our greatest friend and President Trump is a great friend of Israel, and we will work together; we are working together,” he added.\nSa’ar noted that “there is no other world leader” with whom Trump has spent more time than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nNetanyahu, who is deeply skeptical of the Iran-US talks, has called for all of Tehran’s nuclear facilities to be dismantled and for its ballistic missile program to be stopped as part of any credible deal.\nTehran has insisted that the talks be solely focused on the nuclear issue and the lifting of sanctions, ruling out negotiations on military capabilities.\nJerusalem is reportedly unhappy with the state of the talks, which were said to be developing into a largely similar framework to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, which was signed by then-US president Barack Obama and was panned at the time by Netanyahu as disastrous for Israel. Trump also maligned the accord before withdrawing from it in 2018.",

    "date": "Updated 07:21 PM GMT+5:30, May 11, 2025",
    "article": "The Cannes Film Festival, which begins on Tuesday, will include several movies this year that focus on the war between Israel and the Hamas terror group in Gaza, including a documentary whose protagonist was killed in an Israeli strike last month.\nFatima Hassouna, a 25-year-old Gazan photojournalist, is the main character in Iranian filmmaker Sepideh Farsi’s documentary, “Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk.”\nThe filmmaker, a refugee from Iran, made the movie from video phone calls with Hassouna over more than 200 days of war.\nOn April 15, Farsi rang the young Palestinian to tell her the film had been selected for Cannes, and they immediately started trying to arrange for her to attend the French festival.\nThe next day, an Israeli airstrike killed Hassouna along with 10 relatives in her family home in northern Gaza. Only her mother survived.\nThe Israel Defense Forces said the strike targeted a Hamas operative involved in attacks on soldiers and civilians.\n“Prior to the strike, measures were taken to minimize the risk to civilians, including the use of precision munitions, aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence,” the IDF said.\nAt the time, Cannes said in a statement that it wished “to express its horror and deep sorrow at this tragedy, which has moved and shocked the entire world,” saying the film’s screening would be “a way of honoring the memory of the young woman, a victim like so many others of the war.”\n????Heartbreaking: Fatima Hassouna was a gifted artist, photographer, and journalist — a brave voice from Gaza known for her powerful images and storytelling. Today, Israel killed Fatima and ten of her family members, silencing a lens that showed the world Gaza’s truth. pic.twitter.com/wRfYKiZDAY\n— Gaza Notifications (@gazanotice) April 16, 2025\nThe war in Gaza started on October 7, 2023, when some 5,000 Hamas-led terrorists invaded southern Israel from Gaza, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, 58 of whom are still held in Gaza along with the body of a soldier killed in 2014. Twenty-four of the hostages are officially believed to be alive, though Israel has expressed “grave concern” about three of them.\nFarsi’s documentary is likely to draw attention to the war, at a festival where the conflict was already present last year.\nAt the Berlinale festival in February, British movie star Tilda Swinton lashed out at “internationally enabled mass murder” in Gaza.\nTwo fiction features at Cannes are also likely to spark discussion of the war, in sections parallel to the main competition.\nGazan twin brothers Arab and Tarzan Nasser will screen “Once Upon a Time in Gaza,” a tale of two friends peddling drugs from a falafel shop in 2007. That year, Hamas forcibly took control of the Strip from the Palestinian Authority, which had governed the area after Israel’s unilateral withdrawal in 2005.\nThe film — in the Un Certain Regard section — is the latest from the exiled duo to show at the festival, with several of their earlier works set in Gaza but filmed in Jordan.\nMeanwhile, Israeli director Nadav Lapid, whose work frequently touches on Israeli identity and the conflict with the Palestinians, will be showing “Yes” in the Directors’ Fortnight program. The film is to follow a jazz musician tasked with setting to music a new national anthem in the aftermath of the October 7 attack.",

    "date": "Updated 02:59 PM GMT+5:30, May 11, 2025",
    "article": "US President Donald Trump’s meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh on Tuesday is also set to include Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Syria’s de facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, Arabic media reported Sunday.\nCiting an informed source who declined to be identified, Palestinian newspaper Al-Quds said the Saudi prince “looks forward to Trump’s agreement to the Saudi condition of establishing a Palestinian state.” Trump had said in February that Saudi Arabia was no longer demanding Palestinian statehood as a condition for normalizing ties with Israel, a statement that at the time drew an urgent Saudi denial.\nAccording to the source cited by Al-Quds, Trump had acceded to bin Salman’s request to include the other Arab leaders in the meeting, which will come at the start of Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates between May 13 and 16.\nTrump will not be visiting Israel, whose government accuses both Abbas and Sharaa of supporting terrorism.\nThe US president predicted ahead of his trip that Saudi-Israeli normalization would happen “very quickly,” but in the meantime, he has reportedly dropped normalization with Israel as a condition for progress on Saudi Arabia’s civilian nuclear program.\nIt had been reported Saturday that Trump would announce US recognition of Palestinian statehood, but Washington’s envoy to Israel Mike Huckabee dismissed the report as “nonsense.”\nIsrael-Saudi normalization seemed just around the corner before the Hamas onslaught of October 7, 2023, that started the war in Gaza. Two Israeli ministers made unprecedented state visits to the desert kingdom in the weeks before the shock assault that sparked the war in Gaza. But the prospect of normalization faded as anti-Israel sentiment reached new heights in the Muslim world amid the war.\nDuring his first term, Trump brokered the Abraham Accords normalization agreements between Israel, the UAE, Morocco, Sudan and Bahrain, partly in exchange for Israel backing away from a plan to annex the West Bank, the seat of the Palestinian Authority.\nTrump in his first term also proposed a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that would have seen a truncated Palestinian state established in parts of the West Bank, Gaza and the Negev Desert. The plan was rejected outright by both the PA and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s pro-settler coalition partners.\nIsrael has long accused the PA of inciting violence against Jews in its school system and through stipends paid to families of Palestinian terrorists detained in Israeli prisons. Abbas ordered an end to the so-called play-to-play system in February, less than a month after Trump took office for the second time.\nThe meeting in Riyadh on Tuesday comes as Trump has reportedly expressed frustration over the failure to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, which has been devastated over 19 months of war. The PA had previously threatened to cut ties with Trump over a plan he announced in February to take over Gaza, oust its residents and rebuild the devastated Strip as a coastal resort.\nA rival Egyptian plan for postwar Gaza would have ultimately handed the Strip over to the PA, but Netanyahu has rejected any role for the unpopular body in Gaza’s postwar governance.\nSeparately, Israel has maintained troop presence and carried out military strikes in southern Lebanon following the ceasefire with Hezbollah in November, and ib the Syrian side of the Golan Heights following Sharaa’s ouster in December of Syria’s Iran-backed president Bashar al-Assad. Both Lebanese President Aoun and Syria’s Sharaa have demanded that Israel withdraw from their respective countries.",

    "date": "Updated 02:49 PM GMT+5:30, May 11, 2025",
    "article": "When US President Donald Trump lands in Riyadh on Tuesday, he will be greeted with opulent ceremonies, gilded palaces, and the prospect of $1 trillion in investments. But the raging war in Gaza has denied him one goal he has long craved: Saudi-Israel normalization.\nBehind the scenes, US officials are quietly pressing Israel to agree to an immediate ceasefire in Gaza — one of Saudi Arabia’s preconditions for any restart of normalization talks, said two Gulf sources close to official circles and a US official.\nTrump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff told an audience at the Israeli embassy in Washington this week that he imminently expected progress on expanding the Abraham Accords, a set of deals brokered by Trump in his first term under which several Arab states — the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco — recognized Israel.\nHowever, opposition by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a permanent stop to the war or to the creation of a Palestinian state makes progress on similar talks with Riyadh unlikely, two of the sources said.\n“We think we will have some or a lot of announcements very, very shortly, which we hope will yield progress by next year,” Witkoff said in a video of his speech. He is expected to accompany Trump on his visit to the Middle East.\nSaudi Arabia does not recognize Israel as legitimate, meaning the Middle East’s two most advanced economies and military powers do not have formal diplomatic ties. Supporters of normalizing relations say it would bring stability and prosperity to the region, while countering Iran’s influence.\nEstablishing ties has become especially toxic for Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered on October 7, 2023, when the Palestinian terror group Hamas led a devastating invasion of southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 taken as hostages to Gaza.\nAs such, the issue, central to bilateral talks in Trump’s first term, has effectively been delinked from economic and other security matters between Washington and the kingdom, according to six other sources Reuters spoke with for this story, including two Saudi and two US officials. The people all asked to remain anonymous to speak about sensitive diplomatic conversations.\nSaudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, needs the Gaza war to end and a credible path to a Palestinian state “before he re-engages with the issue of normalization,” said Dennis Ross, a former US negotiator.\nIn the meantime, Washington and Riyadh will focus Trump’s trip largely on the economic partnership and other regional matters, according to the six sources. Lucrative investments such as major deals in arms, mega-projects and artificial intelligence are in play, officials from both sides stressed.\nThe approach was cemented in diplomatic talks between Saudi and US officials ahead of the trip, the first formal state visit of Trump’s second term, they said.\nTrump’s stated aim is to secure a trillion-dollar investment in US companies, building on an initial commitment of $600 billion pledged by the crown prince.\nThe wealthy kingdom, the world’s top oil exporter, knows the ritual well: dazzle the guest, secure the favor. The goal, the sources told Reuters, is to evade diplomatic landmines and perhaps, one said, to win concessions from Trump on the Gaza war and its aftermath.\n“The Trump administration wants this trip to be a big deal. That means lots of splashy deal announcements and collaborations that can be sold as being good for America,” said Robert Mogielnicki, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute, a think tank in Washington.\n“Normalizing ties with Israel is a much heavier lift than rolling out the red carpet for President Trump and announcing investment deals,” he said.\nA State Department spokesperson declined to comment on any understanding reached ahead of the trip, saying Trump “will look to strengthen ties between the United States and our Arab Gulf partners during the visits.”\nThe Saudi government communications office did not reply to a request for comment.\nBefore Hamas launched its October 7 attacks on Israel, the crown prince was finalizing a landmark diplomatic agreement: a US defense pact in exchange for Riyadh recognizing Israel.\nBut the scale of Israel’s campaign to destroy Hamas, topple its Gaza regime, and free the hostages forced a pause in the talks.\nThe Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 50,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though the toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between civilians and fighters.\nIsrael says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.\nIn November last year, bin Salman accused Israel of genocide.\nFrustrated by the impact of Gaza’s prolonged crisis on normalization efforts, Trump could use his visit to unveil a US framework to end the 18-month war, the two Gulf sources said.\nThe plan could create a transitional government and new security arrangements for postwar Gaza, potentially reshaping regional diplomacy and opening the door to future normalization talks, they said.\nUnderscoring the high-stakes diplomacy underway, Trump met privately with Israel’s Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer on Thursday to discuss the war and nuclear talks with Iran, Axios reported.\nThe US State Department did not immediately respond to questions about Trump’s discussions on Gaza.\nTrump conspicuously has not announced a visit to Israel as part of his tour of the region. Two diplomats noted the US president has recently refrained from talking about his “Gaza Riviera” plan, which enraged the Arab world with the suggestion of resettling the entire Gazan population and US ownership of the strip.\nIn the build-up to the trip, Washington has taken a number of actions that are positive for Saudi Arabia. An agreement to stop US bombing of the Houthis in Yemen is in line with a Saudi ceasefire there. Washington has also delinked civil nuclear talks from the normalization question.\nThe stalled Saudi-US defense pact, initially conceived as a formal treaty, was revived in the scaled-back form of security guarantees late in the Biden presidency to bypass congressional opposition.\nThe Trump administration has now picked up those talks, along with the discussions about a civilian nuclear agreement, three of the sources said, while cautioning that it will take time to define terms.\nTrump’s Saudi trip is his first formal state visit and second foreign trip since his re-election, after attending the pope’s funeral in Rome. He will also visit Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\nBeneath the showmanship of Trump’s visits, diplomats say, lies also a calculated US effort to reassert influence and reshape economic alignments in a region where Beijing — Washington’s chief economic rival — has steadily expanded its foothold at the heart of the petrodollar system.\nTrump’s first trip abroad in his first term also began in Riyadh, where he unveiled $350 billion in Saudi investments.\nTrump commands deep trust from the Saudi leadership, rooted in the close ties during his first term — a period defined by large arms deals and steadfast US backing for bin Salman, even as global outrage erupted over the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul.\nSaudi Arabia and its Gulf allies now plan to urge Trump to ease US regulations that have increasingly deterred foreign investment, particularly in sectors deemed part of America’s “critical national infrastructure,” five industry sources said.\nIn meetings with US officials, Saudi ministers will advocate for a more business-friendly climate, especially at a time when China is aggressively courting Gulf capital, the industry sources said.\nWhile countering China’s economic rise may top Trump’s foreign policy agenda, it won’t be easy in Saudi Arabia. Since the launch of Vision 2030, China has become integral to the kingdom’s plans, dominating sectors from energy and infrastructure to renewables.",

    "date": "Updated 02:26 PM GMT+5:30, May 11, 2025",
    "article": "International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan allegedly forced sexual intercourse upon a member of staff on multiple occasions, the Wall Street Journal said Saturday, in a report that questioned whether the allegations may have prompted his decision to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-defense minister Yoav Gallant.\nThe report said that at the time — weeks after the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, onslaught — Khan was coming under increasing pressure to take action over Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, and that he had been lashing out at his team.\nA Malaysian lawyer in her 30s reportedly asked to meet with Kahn to ask him to change the manner in which he interacted with the staff. In response, he summoned her to his suite in the Millennium Hilton Hotel next to the UN headquarters in New York.\nAccording to the report, the woman testified to UN officials that Khan started to touch her in a sexual manner, something that she said had been occurring for a number of months.\n“She said she attempted to leave the room several times, but he took her hand and eventually pulled her to the bed. Then he pulled off her pants and forced sexual intercourse, according to the testimony,” the report said.\n“He always holds on to me and leads me to the bed,” she said in testimony reviewed by the Journal. “It’s the feeling of being trapped.”\nThe report said the woman, a married mother, claimed it was one of multiple incidents of “coerced sexual intercourse” but that she stayed in the job because she felt it was an important role in human rights, and she was additionally paying for medical care for her mother. The report said she also began to fear retaliation if she were to complain.\nThe woman alleged that Khan carried out “nonconsensual sex acts” in New York, Colombia, Congo, Chad, and Paris, as well as at a residence owned by his wife in The Hague, the report said.\nKhan, through his lawyers, told the newspaper that it is “categorically untrue that he has engaged in sexual misconduct of any kind.”\nThe newspaper said that just two and a half weeks after Khan learned of the allegations, on May 20, 2024, he announced his intention to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant over the war in Gaza, in addition to Hamas leaders. The day before, he had canceled a fact-finding mission to Israel and Gaza for which he had pressed then-US secretary of state Anthony Blinken to convince Israel to grant him access to Gaza, the report said, citing a May 3, 2024, phone call between the two. According to the newspaper, it was at that time that Khan found out about the allegations against him.\n“The timing of the announcement has spurred questions about whether Khan was aiming to protect himself from the sexual-assault allegations. The day before announcing the warrant application, Khan abruptly canceled a trip to Israel and Gaza that he had previously said was important to make his decision,” the report said.\nAccording to the Journal, Alan Dershowitz had been organizing a meeting that was set to take place during the trip between Khan and Netanyahu.\nLawyers for Khan denied any connection between the allegations and the warrants.\nKhan said the fact that the ICC judges approved the warrants shows that the evidence for them “met the rigorous legal threshold required.” The report also noted that already in March 2024, Khan had notified US State Department officials that he intended to seek the arrest warrants, and that was before the allegations were made against him.\nHowever, court officials told the newspaper that the arrest warrants ensured support for Khan from anti-Israel countries if the allegations were to become public and additionally discouraged his accuser from coming forward.\nThe woman allegedly told investigators that Khan had informed her that her accusations would harm the investigation into the Gaza war.\n“Think about the Palestinian arrest warrants,” she said he told her, according to her testimony.\nThe woman, a Muslim, was said to support investigations of Netanyahu, Gallant, and Hamas. She reportedly later told colleagues she didn’t want to harm the arrest warrant process by filing a complaint. On April 29 of that year, she eventually told officials about the alleged assaults, and on May 5, the ICC’s internal investigation agency contacted her.\nOn November 24, 2024, the ICC issued warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. The Prime Minister’s Office panned the move in a statement as an “antisemitic decision” and asserted that it stemmed from Khan’s efforts to “save his skin from the serious charges against him for sexual harassment” as well as the beliefs of “biased judges motivated by antisemitic hatred of Israel.”\nICC Warrants were also issued against three Hamas leaders, all of whom have since been killed by Israel.\nLast month, it was reported that United Nations investigators examining the allegations of sexual misconduct were also looking into allegations that Khan retaliated against staff who reported the allegations or were critical of his handling of the matter.\nKhan has alleged that the accusations against him were part of an effort to undermine the ICC. The Journal report said that court officials were concerned that the Mossad was operating at The Hague. No further details were given.\nKhan remains in his position. The ICC did not respond to a Journal request for comment.",

    "date": "Updated 05:05 AM GMT+5:30, May 11, 2025",
    "article": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AFP) — During his nine years living in Tennessee, Fahd, a Saudi national, found comfort and consistency at Dunkin’, where he placed the same order every day.\nNow back in Riyadh, Fahd is doing something similar, highlighting the Saudi Arabian love affair with all things American that many find surprising.\n“When I came here, thank God, the same cafe and same order were here too,” said the 31-year-old mechanical engineer, who did not want to give his family name. “I started living the same lifestyle here as I did in America.”\nSaudi Arabia, often known for its religious austerity, is home to Islam’s holiest sites and welcomes millions of Muslim pilgrims every year.\nIt also has — as just one example — more than 600 branches of Dunkin’ (formerly Dunkin’ Donuts), serving roughly 250,000 of its 35-million population each day, according to the US franchise.\nDespite its image as a cloistered and traditional society, life in Saudi Arabia is awash in Western corporate influence, especially from American companies.\nBuffalo Wild Wings, Chuck-e-Cheese and Starbucks populate Riyadh’s sprawl of office parks and shopping centers, while the capital’s traffic-clogged streets heave with hulking American SUVs and pickup trucks.\nThe nations have shared a tight bond since King Abdulaziz bin Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, and US president Franklin Roosevelt shook hands onboard a US cruiser in the Suez Canal during the final months of World War II.\nIn the ensuing decades, the United States has been at the forefront of providing military protection in return for privileged access to Saudi Arabia’s colossal oil reserves.\nThe Saudi riyal is pegged to the greenback and US leaders have been regular guests, including Donald Trump, who arrives in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday on the first major overseas trip of his second term.\nThe relationship has faced rough patches — including the oil embargo in the 1970s, the September 11, 2001, terror attacks carried out by mostly Saudi hijackers, and the gruesome murder of US-based dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul in 2018.\nBut for Saudis, the ties that bind, including a love of American food, cars and movies, remain strong — even after a grassroots campaign to boycott US products that has swept the region during the Israel-Hamas war.\n“The one thing we never disagree on is going to an American restaurant — especially Buffalo Wild Wings,” Dalal Abdulaziz, 28, told AFP, saying that chicken wings were one of her favorite foods.\n“You’ll find American restaurants in every neighborhood here. We eat it weekly, almost like Saudi food.”\nKhaled Salman Al-Dosari agrees, saying it is hard to find a single street in Saudi Arabia without an American brand on offer.\n“American companies’ products have become an inseparable part of our day,” added the 21-year-old student in Riyadh.\nWhile many American companies have been in Saudi Arabia for decades, its Vision 2030 agenda — the oil-dependent country’s giant economic diversification plan — has opened it up and paved the way for further investment.\nLive music and cinemas were all forbidden until recent years, but MMA fights and US professional wrestling are now among the entertainment offers available to Saudi consumers.\n“I think many Americans would be surprised at the extent to which American brands are all over Saudi Arabia,” said Andrew Leber from the Department of Political Science at Tulane University.\nSome see further correlations in terms of climate, architecture — dry, dusty Riyadh, with its wide concrete boulevards, evokes an Arab Dallas — and even mindset.\n“Texas is close to Riyadh in terms of climate,” said Fahd, the mechanical engineer. “And its people are conservative like us.”\nMeanwhile, the Saudi taste for US products has benefits for the tens of thousands of Americans working in the kingdom, many of them in the oil industry.\n“It always… reminds me of home and keeps that connection with the places that I’ve seen since I’ve been growing up,” said Joshua Dunning, a 36-year-old American business developer working at a Saudi tech firm.\n“It’s always a nice reminder.”",

    "date": "Updated 04:27 AM GMT+5:30, May 11, 2025",
    "article": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Saturday that if the United States’ goal was to deprive Iran of its “nuclear rights,” Tehran would never back down on that front.\nAraghchi was speaking in Doha a day ahead of another round of planned nuclear talks between Iran and the US in Oman.\n“If the goal of the negotiations is to deprive Iran of its nuclear rights, I state clearly that Iran will not back down from any of its rights,” state media quoted Araghchi as saying.\nIran has repeatedly said its right to enrich uranium is non-negotiable and has ruled out a “zero enrichment” demand by some US officials.\nBut US President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said in an interview on Friday that Iran’s “enrichment facilities have to be dismantled” under any accord with the United States.\nTrump, who withdrew Washington from a 2015 deal between Tehran and world powers meant to curb its nuclear activity, has threatened to bomb Iran if no new deal is reached to resolve the long-unresolved dispute.\nWestern countries say Iran’s nuclear program, which Tehran accelerated after the US walkout from the now moribund 2015 accord, is geared toward producing weapons, whereas Iran insists it is purely for civilian purposes. However, Tehran regularly threatens to flatten Israeli cities and is currently enriching uranium to levels that have no civilian use.\n“In its indirect talks with the United States, Iran emphasizes its right to peaceful use of nuclear energy and clearly declares that it is not seeking nuclear weapons,” Araghchi claimed.\n“Iran continues negotiations in good faith, and if the goal of these talks is to ensure the non-acquisition of nuclear weapons, an agreement is possible. However, if the aim is to limit Iran’s nuclear rights, Iran will never retreat from its rights.”\nWitkoff was set to travel to Oman on Sunday for the fourth round of Omani-mediated talks with Araghchi, a source familiar with the matter said. The fourth round of negotiations, initially scheduled for May 3 in Rome, was postponed, with mediator Oman citing “logistical reasons.”\nAraghchi visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar on Saturday, a day before the fourth round of negotiations and days before Trump is expected to visit those countries. Trump is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates from May 13 to 16 on his first major Middle East trip of his second term. The president is not expected to visit Israel on the trip.\nTrump provoked Araghchi’s ire earlier this month by indicating that the US would decide what to call the Persian Gulf, following reports that Washington could officially rename it the Gulf of Arabia. Araghchi condemned the decision as showing “hostile intent toward Iran and its people.”\nAhead of the trip, Trump had predicted that Saudi-Israel normalization would happen “very quickly.” However, sources cited by Reuters have said Trump has dropped the demand that Saudi Arabia normalize relations with Israel as a condition for progress on a civil nuclear program.\nJacob Magid and agencies contributed to this report.",

    "date": "Updated 02:01 AM GMT+5:30, May 11, 2025",
    "article": "US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said in several interviews aired on Israeli television on Saturday that, despite reports that the relationship between US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has soured, the bond between the US leader and the Jewish state is as strong as it has ever been.\nAsked about Trump’s decision to skip Israel in his upcoming visit to the Middle East, which will include stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, Huckabee said that it was not an indication of a deteriorating relationship between Washington and Jerusalem.\n“His first trip is about economic opportunity. That’s where his focus is,” Huckabee said in the interview with Channel 12 news.\n“What he’s doing is not because he’s snubbing Israel,” he insisted. “There are 200 nations in the world, almost, so there are a lot of them he hasn’t gone to yet, a lot of them he isn’t going to right away — he’s spent more time with the prime minister of Israel than he has any other world leader. I think that says a lot.”\n“I would just say to people, ‘Relax, calm down, Donald Trump loves you, there’s no doubt about that, he’s got your back,’” the US ambassador said. “He is the same Donald Trump that, for four years as president, did more for Israel than any other American president.”\nIn a separate interview with i24 News, he made similar arguments and asserted that Netanyahu “has spent more time with Donald Trump in the last three months than I have.”\nIn another interview to Channel 13, Huckabee said he was sure that Trump would visit Israel in the coming year.\nHuckabee insisted that Trump and Netanyahu have an “outstanding relationship,” and that Trump “cares deeply about Israel.”\n“America understands that we don’t have a bigger ally” than Israel, he said.\nIn a fourth interview with the Kan public broadcaster, Huckabee — a longtime ardent backer of Israeli settlements in the West Bank — was asked whether he supports settlements being built in Gaza, as advocated by some on the right, including coalition members and ministers.\n“I certainly have strong opinions, I’ve articulated them through many, many years of being here, but my job is to serve the interests of the president and to articulate his positions,” he replied. “And frankly, the issue of the settlements is not an American issue — it’s an Israeli issue. I will follow the dictates of the president’s policy here. But we also recognize that America won’t make that decision as to how Israel will approach Judea and Samaria — it will be a decision made in Israel by the Israelis.”\nIn the Channel 13 interview, Huckabee also spoke about the ongoing nuclear talks between the US and Iran, and was asked whether Washington would support Israel carrying out military action against Iran if such a deal is signed, should the Jewish state still deem it to be a threat.\n“The United States has never stood in the way, this president has never stood in the way, of Israel from defending itself,” he said.\n“I know there is anxiety here, I sense it,” he said, but he urged Israelis to “look at what the president has done [for Israel].”\nJerusalem is reportedly unhappy with the ongoing US-Iran talks, which are said to be developing into a largely similar framework to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, which was signed by then-US president Barack Obama and was panned at the time by Netanyahu as disastrous for Israel.\nUnder the terms being discussed, according to reports, Iran would limit stockpile size and centrifuge types, and dilute, export or seal its 60 percent uranium stock under unprecedented International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) scrutiny, in exchange for substantial sanctions relief.\nThis approach has not aligned with Netanyahu’s longtime position, which is that Israel will not allow Iran to attain nuclear weapons and is opposed to any talks that don’t lead Iran to agree to a “Libya-style agreement,” under which Tehran’s entire nuclear program — both military and civilian — would be dismantled completely.\nWhen asked if the US supports the Israeli military’s new plans for a ramped-up offensive against Hamas in Gaza, even if it endangers the remaining hostages held captive there, Huckabee answered that “everyone… wants the hostages to come home first, and that’s the highest priority.”\n“We all want to see hostages released,” he said, but he made sure to clarify that the only reason the hostages are in any danger was because of Hamas, saying it is “inappropriate, and frankly insulting” to say that the reason the hostages are in danger is because of decisions from US or Israeli leaders.\nThe war began with the Hamas-led invasion of southern Israel on October 7, 2023, during which thousands of terrorists killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages to Gaza.\n“If Hamas would act like civilized people, this would be over,” he said, insisting that pressure should be put on the terror group, not the Israeli government, to agree to a deal to free the 59 hostages who are still held in Gaza, 35 of whom have been confirmed by Israel to be dead.\nIn his interviews, the envoy also pushed back on criticism within Israel of the recent deal signed between the US and the Houthi rebels in Yemen regarding a cessation of US bombing if the Iran-backed rebels stop firing on US shipping, which notably left the door open for Houthi strikes on Israel to go unabated.\nIsrael was not told in advance about the agreement, officials said. It was announced by Trump two days after a Houthi missile impacted the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, a few hundred yards from the main control tower, lightly injuring several people and prompting most foreign airlines to halt flights to Israel.\n“Here’s what I can tell you, because I had a conversation with both the president and the vice president last night,” Huckabee told Channel 12. “There’s 700,000 Americans living in Israel. If the Houthis want to continue doing things to Israel and they hurt an American, then it becomes our business.”\nAsked to clarify whether he meant that the US would only intervene to fight the rebel group if a US citizen was hurt by a Houthi missile, the ambassador said: “It’s a matter of what becomes our immediate business.”\nHis remarks echoed those made by Trump, who, when asked about the Houthis pledging to continue attacking Israel notwithstanding their agreement with the US, responded: “I’ll discuss that if something happens.”\nHuckabee noted that “the United States isn’t required to get permission from Israel to make some type of arrangement that would get the Houthis from firing on our ships.”\nAsked about the many reports that Netanyahu was caught off guard by the announcement of the US-Houthi deal, the former Arkansas governor told Kan: “I don’t know what he knew and when he knew it. I know he was informed, I do not know at what time.”\nSince the deal between the US and the Houthis was signed, the Iran-backed Yemeni group has continued firing missiles and drones at Israel, which Jerusalem has vowed to retaliate for.\nAsked by i24 about Trump’s coordination with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Syria, a matter where Ankara is at odds with Jerusalem and where a power struggle is brewing, Huckabee said the two leaders’ good ties don’t mean they can’t disagree behind closed doors.\nHe said Trump strives to maintain good relationships with many leaders he has disagreements with, noting his past meetings with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jinping and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.\nAlso on Saturday, Huckabee responded to a report in the Jerusalem Post that cited a “Gulf diplomatic source” as saying that Trump would soon recognize a Palestinian state, calling it “nonsense,” and claiming his toddler grandson was a more reliable source than the anonymous Gulf source quoted in the report.\nThere has been some speculation as to what Trump will be announcing on his upcoming Middle East trip, which he has teased as a “very, very big announcement,” but the Post report was the first to suggest that it could have anything to do with the US recognizing a Palestinian state, something Trump has never suggested would be a possibility.\nHmm.  @Jerusalem_Post needs better sources than this unidentified “source.”  My 4 yr old grandson Teddy is more reliable.  And take it from Teddy.  This report is nonsense.  @Israel doesn’t have a better friend than @POTUS ! https://t.co/N3YYgdXYCW\n— Ambassador Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) May 10, 2025\nThe United States has long opposed Palestinian efforts to unilaterally secure statehood status, arguing that the goal should be achieved through direct negotiations with Israel.\nEven under the previous US administration, led by then-president Joe Biden, which was seen as more vocally sympathetic toward the Palestinians, the White House insisted that the Palestinian Authority would need to undergo significant reforms before a Palestinian state was recognized. Ramallah has long been marred by allegations of corruption and mismanagement.",

    "article": "Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa has said he’s sought assistance from Israel and the United Arab Emirates to combat the drug cartels that are terrorizing the South American country.\nIn an interview in Paris on Thursday night, the iron-fisted 37-year-old who won reelection last month said Israel and the UAE have agreed to provide intelligence “to help” fight cocaine traffickers.\nOnce-peaceful Ecuador averaged a killing every hour at the start of the year, as cartels battle for control over cocaine routes that pass through the nation’s ports.\nDuring presidential campaigning, Noboa suggested US special forces should be deployed to Ecuador to tackle the violence and floated legal reforms to allow US bases to reopen.\nOver the past week, he traveled to Italy, Spain, Britain and France — some of the European countries experiencing rocketing cocaine consumption — to develop further security alliances, as well as Israel and the United Arab Emirates.\nHe said he spoke to Israeli and Emirati leaders about “cooperation on security at ports and borders… since the violence is there, in the areas or on the routes to the ports.”\nBut Noboa admitted that “there is not much interest so far” from foreign powers in establishing military bases in the Andean country.\nIn March, he announced a security alliance with Erik Prince, founder of the controversial American security company Blackwater, whose employees killed and wounded dozens of civilians in Iraq.\nAsked about the pact, Noboa said Prince was merely acting in a “consultancy” capacity.\nAfter a close-run race in the first round of Ecuador’s election Noboa easily defeated left-wing lawyer Luisa Gonzalez in April’s run-off.\nWhile Gonzalez had pitched herself as a political everywoman who would improve the lot of poor Ecuadorans, Noboa — heir to a banana export empire — staked his political fortunes on his war on the cartels.\nIn March, he announced a preemptive amnesty for security forces fighting gangs in the violence-wracked port of Guayaquil, despite allegations of gross rights abuses by the military particularly.\nHis tough talk appeared to pay off, with the incumbent taking an 11-point lead over his rival.\nGonzalez rejected the results as fraudulent, without providing proof of her claim.\nNoboa said his win was a “vote of confidence” in his policies.\nHe faces a tough task to unite a country grappling with its dramatic decline in fortunes.\nRampant bloodshed has spooked investors and tourists alike, fueling economic malaise and swelling the ranks of Ecuador’s poor to 28 percent of the population.\n“More than anything, we need to attract foreign investment,” Noboa said.\nBut in order to access bond markets, the government needs to lower its country’s risk factor.\nNoboa assured that Ecuador’s economic fundamentals were “not bad,” citing low inflation and record bank deposits, among other indicators.\n“Our focus is job creation,” he said.",

    "subheading": "Leo indicates intent to maintain some of the core priorities of Pope Francis while also charting his own path",
    "date": "Updated 07:41 PM GMT+5:30, May 10, 2025",
    "article": "VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Leo XIV laid out the vision of his papacy Saturday, identifying artificial intelligence as one of the most critical matters facing humanity and vowing to continue with some of the core priorities of Pope Francis.\nBut in a sign he was making the papacy very much his own, Leo made his first outing since his election to a sanctuary south of Rome that is dedicated to the Madonna and is of particular significance to his Augustinian order.\nTownspeople of Genazzano gathered in the square outside the main church housing the Madre del Buon Consiglio (Mother of Good Counsel) sanctuary as Leo arrived in a car, flanked by Vatican security. The sanctuary, which is managed by Augustinian friars, has been a place of pilgrimage since the 15th century, and Leo visited it last year.\nThe after-lunch outing came after Leo presided over his first formal audience, with the cardinals who elected him pope. In it, Leo repeatedly cited Francis and the Argentine pope’s own 2013 mission statement, making clear a commitment to making the Catholic Church more inclusive and attentive to the faithful and a church that looks out for the “least and rejected.”\nLeo, the first American pope, told the cardinals that he was fully committed to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, the 1960s meetings that modernized the church. He identified AI as one of the main issues facing humanity, saying it poses challenges to defending human dignity, justice and labor.\nLeo referred to AI in explaining the choice of his name: His namesake, Pope Leo XIII, was pope from 1878 to 1903 and laid the foundation for modern Catholic social thought. He did so most famously with his 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum, which addressed workers’ rights and capitalism at the dawn of the industrial age. The late pope criticized both laissez-faire capitalism and state-centric socialism, giving shape to a distinctly Catholic vein of economic teaching.\nIn his remarks Saturday, Leo said he identified with his predecessor, who addressed the great social question of the day posed by the industrial revolution in the encyclical.\n“In our own day, the church offers everyone the treasury of its social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice and labor,” he said.\nToward the end of his pontificate, Francis became increasingly vocal about the threats to humanity posed by AI and called for an international treaty to regulate it. He warned that such powerful technology risks turning human relations into mere algorithms. Francis brought his message to the Group of Seven industrialized nations when he addressed their summit last year, insisting AI must remain human-centric so that decisions about when to use weapons or even less lethal tools always remain made by humans and not machines.\nThe late Argentine pope also used his 2024 annual peace message to call for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, arguing that a technology lacking human values of compassion, mercy, morality and forgiveness is too perilous to develop unchecked.\nFrancis favored the Chicago-born Augustinian missionary Robert Prevost. He moved him to take over a small Peruvian diocese in 2014, where Prevost later became bishop and head of the Peruvian bishops conference, and then called him to Rome to take over one of the most important Vatican offices vetting bishop nominations in 2023.\nThe Vatican revealed Saturday that Leo would retain the motto and coat of arms that he had as bishop of Chiclayo, Peru. The motto, “In Illo uno unum,” was pronounced by St. Augustine in a sermon to explain that “although we Christians are many, in the one Christ we are one.”\nIn the speech, delivered in Italian in the Vatican’s synod hall – not the Apostolic Palace – Leo made repeated references to Francis and the mourning over his death. He held up Francis’s 2013 mission statement, “The Joy of the Gospel,” as something of his own marching orders.\nHe cited Francis’s insistence on the missionary nature of the church and the need to make its leadership more collegial. He cited the need to pay attention to what the faithful say, “especially in its most authentic and inclusive forms, especially popular piety.”\nAgain, referring to Francis’s 2013 mission statement, Leo cited the need for the church to express “loving care for the least and rejected” and engage in courageous dialogue with the contemporary world.\nGreeted by a standing ovation, Leo read from his prepared text, only looking up occasionally. Even when he first appeared to the world on Thursday night, Leo read from a prepared, handwritten text that he must have drafted sometime before his historic election or the hour or so after. He seemed most comfortable speaking off-the-cuff in the few words he pronounced in Spanish.\nPrevost was elected the 267th pontiff on Thursday on the fourth ballot of the conclave, an exceptionally fast outcome given this was the largest and most geographically diverse conclave in history and not all cardinals knew one another before arriving in Rome.\nCardinals have said Prevost did not make any major speech during the pre-conclave discussions, and he carried into the conclave the traditional taboo precluding a pope from the United States, given America’s superpower status. But Prevost was already known to many.\nThey said he made an impression in smaller groups where English was the key language of communication in a conclave that brought together 133 cardinals from 70 countries.\nMadagascar Cardinal Désiré Tsarahazana told reporters on Saturday that on the final ballot, Prevost had received “more” than 100 votes. That suggests an extraordinary margin, well beyond the two-thirds, or 89 votes, necessary to be elected.\nCardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state who had been considered one of the top contenders to be pope, offered his congratulations on Saturday in a letter published in his hometown paper, Il Giornale di Vicenza.\nParolin praised Leo’s grasp of today’s problems, recalling his first words from the loggia when he spoke of the need for a peace that is “disarmed and disarming.” Parolin said he had appreciated Prevost’s leadership in Chiclayo, saying he helped handle a particularly thorny problem — with no details — and grew to appreciate his governance more closely at the Vatican, handling the bishops’ office.\nSpecifically, Parolin praised Leo’s understanding of people and situations, his “calmness in argumentation, balance in proposing solutions, respect, care and love for everyone.”",

    "article": "The Israeli military said Saturday that it was close to defeating all remaining Palestinian terror operatives in southern Gaza’s Rafah, with fighting now only taking place in the Janina neighborhood.\nTroops of the Golani Brigade have been operating in Janina in recent days. The Israel Defense Forces said the soldiers had destroyed terror infrastructures, located dozens of tunnel shafts and killed dozens of operatives.\n“Janina is the last area where fighting against terrorists in the Rafah Brigade is taking place,” the military said.\nFour IDF soldiers have been killed and several others have been wounded during fighting in the Janina area in the past week.\nMeanwhile, the military said that over the past day, the Israeli Air Force had struck some 60 terror targets across the Gaza Strip. Hamas authorities reported 23 killed and dozens more wounded in the previous 24 hours.\nIn the Strip’s north, the IDF said troops of the 252nd Division killed two gunmen who approached forces; in the Morag Corridor area, the 36th Division struck a booby-trapped building where several operatives were located; and in Rafah, Gaza Division forces destroyed Hamas infrastructure both above and below ground.\nGaza’s Hamas-run civil defense agency said that five people were killed in an Israeli strike on a tent in Gaza City — all members of a single family, according to relatives. The figures could not be verified and did not differentiate between civilians and fighters.\n“Three children, their mother and her husband were sleeping inside a tent and were bombed by an [Israeli] occupation aircraft,” family member Omar Abu al-Kass told AFP. The strikes came “without warning and without [them] having done anything wrong,” Abu al-Kass alleged, saying he was the children’s maternal grandfather.\nImages from the scene showed mourners, some of them weeping, gathering alongside five white shrouds of different sizes.\nThe Israeli army, which resumed its offensive in Gaza on March 18 after a two-month truce, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the strike. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.\nOn Saturday morning, the army said that nine IDF soldiers, including two senior officers, were lightly wounded by an explosive device in Gaza City’s Shejaiya neighborhood overnight.\nThe troops of the Jerusalem Brigade were carrying out scans in Shejaiya when the blast went off. Among the wounded were the commander of the Jerusalem Brigade’s 6310th Battalion and the deputy commander of the 252nd Division. All were taken to a hospital in good condition, the army said.\nSources close to Hamas said Friday that a delegation from the terror group held two meetings with Egyptian and Qatari mediators in Doha this week, but they produced no breakthrough in the search for a Gaza truce.\nThe developments come as Israel and the US look to resume aid deliveries to Gaza while preventing food, medicine and other basic items from being hoarded by Hamas, as they say the terror group has repeatedly done with past supplies.\nIsrael stopped allowing aid into Gaza on March 2 after the first phase of a ceasefire and hostage release deal concluded.\nFor weeks, UN agencies and other humanitarian organizations have warned of dwindling supplies of everything from fuel and medicine to food and clean water in the coastal territory that is home to 2.4 million Palestinians.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that US President Donald Trump expressed frustration with his promised tasks of ending the wars in Ukraine and Gaza in a meeting with top donors in Florida last week.\nCiting people who were in the room, the report said that Trump had said finding a solution in Gaza was difficult because “they’d been fighting for a thousand years.”",

    "article": "JTA — Margot Friedlander, a Holocaust survivor who grew prominent in Germany when she returned from the United States decades after surviving the Holocaust, recently died, aged 103.\nThe Margot Friedlander Foundation announced her death on Friday, just weeks after opening applications for a 25,000 euro prize to recognize efforts to fight antisemitism and promote democracy. Friedlander was known for her concern about the rise of the political far right in Germany, as well as her impeccable style and the mantra she promoted: “Be human.”\nFriedlander had appeared less than two days before her death at Berlin’s commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and the rule of the Nazi Party. There, she read from her story, as she had countless times to student groups, public gatherings and public officials.\nFriedlander was born and raised in Berlin and hid there after the Nazis rose to power and began deporting and murdering Jews. She was apprehended in April 1944 and sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp, where she remained until its liberation a year later. Her entire family had been murdered.\nFriedlander and her husband, whom she met in Theresienstadt, moved to New York City, where they lived an unassuming life in Queens. But after her husband’s death in 1997, she began writing about her Holocaust experience, ultimately catching the eye of a filmmaker who brought her to Germany over the course of making a documentary about her.\nThe trip, which Friedlander had once sworn never to make, changed her life. She moved back permanently in 2010, at age 89, and quickly became a local celebrity, according to a Forward profile that appeared three years after her arrival. She made hundreds if not thousands of appearances to tell her story, taking center stage in a country haunted by its Holocaust history.\nIn 2023, she met with then-Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff during his visit to Berlin. She also presented a prize to Guy Nattiv and Helen Mirren, the director and star of “Golda,” the biopic about Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.\nLast year, according to a Vogue Germany cover story, “she was invited to a member of the Bundestag’s party at Soho House and celebrated until the lights came back on.” That fall, she met with then-US president Joe Biden in Berlin.\n102-year-old Holocaust survivor Margot Friedländer is featured on the July/August cover of Vogue Germany. Margot was born in Berlin in 1921. Her entire family was murdered during the Holocaust, leaving Margot as the only survivor. One of the last things Margot’s mother said to… pic.twitter.com/r1jCChu7T1\n— Humans of Judaism (@HumansOfJudaism) June 20, 2024\n“Margot Friedländer, you are a voice of conscience and healing,” Biden said, according to a White House transcript. “I’m actually honored to be in your presence, for real.”\nIn an interview last year, Friedlander was told that many people’s eyes light up when they hear her name. Asked what makes her eyes light up, she offered an immediate answer: “That it seems like I achieved something.”",

    "article": "ISLAMABAD/JAMMU, India (Reuters) — US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that India and Pakistan had agreed to a “full and immediate ceasefire” after a fourth day of strikes and counter-strikes against each other’s military installations.\nPakistan’s foreign minister also said both countries had agreed to a ceasefire “with immediate effect.” His Indian counterpart confirmed the deal as well.\n“After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\nThe announcement came on a day when fears that the countries’ nuclear arsenals might come into play spiked as the Pakistani military said a top military and civil body overseeing its nuclear weapons would meet.\nBut the Pakistani defense minister later said no such meeting was scheduled.\nAt the same time, officials from both sides showed a willingness, for now, to take a step back following the day’s exchanges, while the civilian death toll on both sides of the border mounted to 66.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the agreement followed extensive negotiations by him and Vice President JD Vance with Indian and Pakistani prime ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif and other top officials.\n“I am pleased to announce the Governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site,” Rubio said on X.\n“We commend Prime Ministers Modi and Sharif on their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace,” he added.\nThe ceasefire deal follows weeks of clashes, missile and drone strikes across their borders that were triggered by a gun massacre of tourists last month that India blamed on Pakistan, which denied the charge.\nPakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar announced the ceasefire on Geo News. He said Saudi Arabia and Turkey played an important role in facilitating the deal.\nIndian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said the heads of military operations from both countries spoke Saturday afternoon.\n“It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all firing and military action on land, and in the air and sea. Instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to this understanding.” The top military officials would speak again on May 12, Misri added.\nThe deal has brought a swift conclusion to the most serious military confrontation between the nuclear-armed rivals in decades.\nTensions soared since an attack at a popular tourist site in India-controlled Kashmir left 26 civilians dead, mostly Indian Hindu tourists, on April 22.\nThe countries have fought several wars over the Muslim-majority Kashmir, which both claim in full but administer separate portions since gaining independence from British rule in 1947. Armed groups have stepped up operations in Kashmir since 2019, when Modi’s Hindu nationalist government revoked its limited autonomy and took the state under direct rule by New Delhi.\nThe conflict caused major disruptions to international aviation, with airlines having to cancel flights or use longer routes that do not overfly the India-Pakistan frontier.\nIndia closed 32 airports, while schools in areas close to the border on both sides were shuttered, affecting millions of children.\nIn recent years, India has been seen as a partner by Western powers to counter China’s rising influence. Pakistan is a US ally, although its importance has diminished since Washington’s 2021 withdrawal from neighboring Afghanistan.\nEarlier Saturday, Pakistan launched counterattacks against India after three of its air bases were struck overnight. Indian Wing Commander Vyomika Singh told a briefing that there were “several high-speed missile attacks” on air bases, but “limited damage” to equipment.\nPakistan earlier accused India of targeting three of its bases with missiles — including one in Rawalpindi, some 10 kilometers (six miles) from the capital, Islamabad.\nAuthorities in Pakistan-administered Kashmir said 11 civilians were killed by Indian shelling overnight.",

    "date": "Updated 02:05 PM GMT+5:30, May 10, 2025",
    "article": "The mother of a hostage held by Hamas in Gaza issued an emotional appeal to US President Donald Trump, who is due in the region this week, not to “give up” on pushing Israel and the terror group toward a ceasefire.\nEinav Zangauker, the mother of hostage Matan Zangauker and one of the leaders of the movement calling for a hostage deal, made the comments ahead of the weekly mass protests calling for the hostages to be freed, to be held Saturday evening.\n“You can’t sweep this under the rug or sugarcoat it. The recent deals, the latest hostages who returned to us — it all happened solely thanks to [Trump],” Zangauker said in an interview with the Walla news site.\n“And I truly know that President Trump has a vision for the Middle East, that he’s not interested in wars, that he’s doing everything to reach agreements — whether it’s with Iran, or Russia and Ukraine — and here too, it matters to him to bring this to an end. But he doesn’t have a partner on our side,” said Zangauker, who has been a fierce critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the government.\nHer comments come as Trump is set to depart for Saudi Arabia on Monday before making stops in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. He is slated to return on Friday, May 16. He has said Israel will not be on the itinerary.\n“And if I could make just one distilled request: Don’t give up on us. Those who came back did so thanks to President Trump. And we need him to stay involved until the last hostage is brought home,” Zangauker said.\nעינב צנגאוקר בראיון ב @WallaNews – \"אם הייתי יכולה להגיד בקשה אחת מזוקקת לנשיא טראמפ. \"Don't give up on us\". מי שחזר חזר בזכות הנשיא טראמפ. ואנחנו חייבים שהוא יהיה מעורב עד שנחזיר את אחרון החטופים\" pic.twitter.com/TPL4PaTCFl\n— Tal Shalev (@talshalev1) May 10, 2025\nHowever, recent signs have indicated that Trump is losing patience with Israel and is increasingly at odds with Netanyahu.\nTrump expressed his frustration at his lack of impact recently in brokering a deal between Israel and Hamas, telling a group of top donors last week that finding a solution to the war in Gaza has been hard because “they’d been fighting for a thousand years,” the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.\nOn the campaign trail, the US president boasted that he could bring the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine to a quick end, but has yet to do so after over 100 days in office.\nOn Ukraine, Trump told the donors that the war kept him up at night, and that dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin was a challenge because he “wanted the whole thing,” referring to all of Ukraine.\nThousands of demonstrators are expected to congregate across Israel on Saturday night to protest against the government and call for a deal to release hostages held by the terror group Hamas, as uncertainty grows about the fate of the remaining captives.\nIn Tel Aviv, the weekly anti-government rally will start at 7:00 p.m. at Habima Square.\nThe demonstration will feature Rafi Ben Shitrit, the former Beit She’an mayor, whose son Alroy was killed on October 7, 2023. Ben Shitrit’s participation is notable because of his past affiliation with Netanyahu’s Likud and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar’s New Hope.\nProtest organizers said that after the rally ends, demonstrators will join demonstrations with hostage families at Hostages Square and Begin Road.\nIn Jerusalem, a demonstration will begin at 8:30 p.m. with a march from Zion Square to Paris Square, near the prime minister’s official residence.\nTerror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 59 hostages, including 58 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the Israel Defense Forces.\nIt is currently believed that 21 of the 59 hostages are alive. The status of three hostages — IDF soldier Tamir Nimordi, Bipin Joshi of Nepal, and Pinta Nattpong of Thailand —is considered highly questionable by Israeli officials because no signs of life have been received from them since the war broke out. No sign of life has been received either from Ariel Cunio, an Israeli civilian.\nAmid the resurgent worry over the hostages’ status, Haaretz revealed Wednesday that in a military document outlining plans for a new Gaza offensive, the IDF had ranked the return of the hostages as its least important objective.\nThe document, presented to commanders on Tuesday, placed the Hamas-held captives in sixth and last place, a fact incongruent with army officials’ previous assertions to the Israeli public that the return of the hostages was the IDF’s most important war goal.\nHamas released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire between January and March. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. In exchange, Israel has freed some 2,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners, and Gazan terror suspects detained during the war.\nEight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.\nThe body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas and is counted among the 59 hostages.",

    "date": "Updated 12:38 PM GMT+5:30, May 10, 2025",
    "article": "Jonatan Urich, the senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, received payments from Qatar dating back to just after war broke out between Israel and the Hamas terror group on October 7, 2023, Hebrew media reported Friday, marking the latest development in the “Qatargate” affair.\nWhile Urich initially denied any involvement with the Qataris and said the investigation was politically motivated, he later admitted to assisting Qatar with matters related to the 2022 World Cup. Sources told Channel 12 news that the latest findings have rendered Urich the main suspect in the Qatargate investigation.\nAccording to Channel 13 news, the police possess documents, text messages, and bank data showing that Urich received payments from Doha after October 7, 2023, when Israel was determining whether to accept the Qataris as mediators in negotiations with Hamas. Payments that could be traced back to Qatar continued to be made to Urich throughout 2024, the Channel 13 report said.\nQatar has been a key mediator, along with Egypt and the US, in Gaza hostage-ceasefire negotiations. In recent years it also sent vast amounts of money, including hundreds of millions of dollars in cash delivered with the support of Netanyahu, into Gaza — funds that IDF and Shin Bet probes have said helped finance Hamas’s war machine and the terror group’s October 7, 2023, invasion and slaughter in southern Israel.\nPolice are reportedly trying to determine whether Urich indeed advanced Qatari interests and whether he received assistance from a second suspect, former Netanyahu aide Eli Feldstein, who has already been charged with leaking classified information in a separate case. Police are also investigating the possibility that Feldstein worked with Qatar independently of Urich.\nThe Qatargate affair has revolved primarily around suspicions that Urich and Feldstein committed multiple offenses tied to their alleged work for the pro-Qatar lobbying firm, including contact with a foreign agent and a series of corrupt actions involving lobbyists and businessmen, all while working for the prime minister.\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal against a decision to keep Urich in custody. Justice Yechiel Kasher stated in his ruling, “I am satisfied that there was no miscarriage of justice in the district court’s decision.”\nAt the session, Urich’s lawyers appeared to admit that their client had worked for Qatar, stating that charges against him were invalid since it is not officially an enemy state.\nIn their appeal, Urich’s lawyers claimed that the district court “made a mistake in defining the offense,” adding that Qatar isn’t defined by Israeli law as an enemy country and arguing that “many officials in Israel, including very senior defense officials,” regularly work with the Gulf nation.\nThey also argued that Urich, as a private individual providing services to the premier’s Likud party rather than a state-employed official, “is allowed to concurrently work in any role.”\nUrich had been brought in for questioning on Wednesday afternoon regarding new evidence the police wished to ask him about, and was arrested just after midnight.\nPolice sought to extend his detention by five days and extend Feldstein’s house arrest by 30 days, but a judge refused both requests and granted police 24 hours to file an appeal against his decision.\nThe judge also raised substantive questions over the investigation, pointing out that although Urich and Feldstein were working for the prime minister, they were not formally employed by the Prime Minister’s Office and were therefore not civil servants.\nOnly civil servants can be charged with crimes, such as bribery and breach of trust, which police wish to level against the two suspects.\nThe ongoing investigation continues to expand, and the Shin Bet and police are now probing the involvement and business connections of two former security officials with Qatar, Hebrew media outlets reported Thursday.\nAccording to Haaretz, the two former Mossad agents were recently questioned by the Shin Bet, and the police sought to question further suspects in connection with the affair.\nOne of the former security officials under investigation is a former Mossad official, referred to only as “Shin,” who worked in cooperation with Qatari intelligence during his time at the spy agency and today does business in Qatar, Channel 12 news reported.\nThe second suspect was said to be David Saig, an Israeli businessman, a former Mossad official and a close friend of Shin, who was Saig’s boss during their time in the Mossad.\nSaig himself has been questioned under caution as a suspect in the Qatargate investigation.\nAccording to Channel 12, Shin owns a company with retired IDF general Yoav Mordechai, who formed connections with the Qataris during his time as head of the Defense Ministry’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT).\nPolice suspect that Mordechai connected two of the central suspects in the Qatargate affair, Urich and former Likud election campaign manager Yisrael Einhorn, to the Qatari government when they did public relations work for Doha ahead of the 2022 World Cup.\nUrich and Einhorn are also suspected of having a business relationship with Shin and Saig, said Channel 12.\nThe report further said that Shin and Mordechai’s company has a relationship with a German company owned by Gil Birger, another Israeli businessman suspected of having transferred money from pro-Qatari lobbyist Jay Footlik to Feldstein.",

    "article": "ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan’s foreign minister said Saturday his country would consider de-escalation if India stopped further attacks. This came after India said it was committed to non-escalation if Pakistan reciprocated.\nBoth countries have traded strikes Saturday, the latest escalation in a conflict triggered by a massacre last month that India blames on Pakistan.\nIshaq Dar, the Pakistani foreign minister, still warned that if India launched any strikes, “our response will follow.”\nDar told Pakistan’s Geo News that he also conveyed this message to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he contacted him after speaking to New Delhi two hours ago.\n“We responded because our patience had reached its limit. If they stop here, we will also consider stopping,” he said.\nIndia said it targeted Pakistani military bases after Islamabad fired several high-speed missiles at multiple Indian air bases in the country’s Punjab state early Saturday.\nPakistan earlier said it intercepted most missiles targeting three air bases and that retaliatory strikes on India were underway.\nIndian Col. Sofiya Qureshi, at a news conference in New Delhi, said Pakistan also targeted health facilities and schools at its three air bases in Indian-controlled Kashmir. “Befitting reply has been given to Pakistani actions,” she said.\nWing Commander Vyomika Singh, who was also present at the news conference, said India was committed to “non-escalation” provided that Pakistan reciprocates. However, Pakistani ground forces were observed mobilizing towards forward areas, she said, “indicating an offensive intent to further escalate the situation.”\n“Indian armed forces remain in a high state of operational readiness,” she added.\nSingh said Indian armed forces carried out “precision strikes only at identified military targets in response to Pakistani actions,” which included technical infrastructure, command and control centres, radar sites and weapon storage areas to ensure “minimum collateral damage.”\nShe said Pakistan had overnight launched several high-speed missiles targeting multiple air bases and civilian infrastructure in the northern Indian state of Punjab.\n“All hostile actions have been effectively countered and responded to appropriately,” she said.\nThe Pakistani army’s actions were “provocation” and India’s response was “measured,” foreign secretary Vikram Misri said.\nMisri also rejected Pakistan military’s claims that it had destroyed several air force stations in India and caused serious damages to artillery depots, military establishments and critical infrastructure, including power stations.\nThe Pakistani military said it used medium-range Fateh missiles to target an Indian missile storage facility and airbases in the cities of Pathankot and Udhampur.\nThe Associated Press could not independently verify all the actions attributed to Pakistan or India.\nArmy spokesman, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif, said Pakistan’s air force assets were safe following the Indian strikes, adding that some of the Indian missiles also hit India’s eastern Punjab.\n“This is a provocation of the highest order,” Sharif said.\nRubio spoke to his Indian counterpart S. Jaishankar and emphasized that “both sides need to identify methods to de-escalate and re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement Saturday.\nRubio also proposed US support in facilitating “productive discussions to avert future disputes,” the statement added.\nState-run Pakistan Television reported that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has convened a meeting of the National Command Authority, the body responsible for overseeing the country’s missile program and other strategic assets.\nTensions between the nuclear-armed rivals have soared since an attack at a popular tourist site in India-controlled Kashmir left 26 civilians dead, mostly Hindu Indian tourists, on April 22. New Delhi has blamed Pakistan for backing the assault, an accusation Islamabad rejects.\nThe call for calm came ahead of Saturday’s Indian missile strikes, which targeted Nur Khan air base in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad, Murid air base in Chakwal city and Rafiqui air base in the Jhang district of eastern Punjab province, according to Pakistan’s military spokesman.\nThere was no media access to the air base in Rawalpindi, a densely populated city, and no immediate reports of residents hearing or seeing the strike or its aftermath.\nFollowing the announcement of Pakistani retaliation, residents in Indian-controlled Kashmir said they heard loud explosions at multiple places in the region, including the two big cities of Srinagar and Jammu, and the garrison town of Udhampur.\n“Explosions that we are hearing today are different from the ones we heard the last two nights during drone attacks,” said Shesh Paul Vaid, the region’s former top police official and Jammu resident. “It looks like a war here.”\nVaid said explosions were heard from areas with military bases, adding it appeared that army sites were being targeted.\nSrinagar appeared calm early Saturday, but some residents in neighborhoods close to the city’s airport, which is also an air base, said they were rattled by the explosions and booming sound of fighter jets.\n“I was already awake, but the explosions jolted my kids out of their sleep. They started crying,” said Srinagar resident Mohammed Yasin, adding he heard at least two explosions.\nPraveen Donthi, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group for India, said the two countries were at war even if they had not yet labelled it as one.\n“It’s become a remorseless race for military one-upmanship with no apparent strategic end goals from either side,” said Donthi. “With increasing civilian casualties on both sides, finding an exit or off-ramp is going to be challenging.”\nIndia’s army said it destroyed multiple armed Pakistani drones that were spotted flying over a military cantonment in northern Punjab state’s Amritsar city early Saturday.\n“Pakistan’s blatant attempt to violate India’s sovereignty and endanger civilians is unacceptable,” the statement said.\nIn Pakistan, the civil aviation authority shut the country’s airports for all flight operations and people in major cities were seen chanting slogans supporting the armed forces.\n“Thank God we have finally responded to Indian aggression,” said Muhammad Ashraf, who had headed out for breakfast in the eastern city of Lahore.\nIndia and Pakistan have traded strikes and heavy cross-border fire for days, resulting in civilian casualties on both sides.\nThe Group of Seven nations, or G7, urged “maximum restraint” from India and Pakistan. It warned Friday that further military escalation posed a serious threat to regional stability.",

    "subheading": "Orthodox university’s rabbis say ‘Hareni’ violated settlement agreement that allowed for its formation; students refuse to include ‘sexual morality’ disclaimer on club’s ads",
    "date": "Updated 10:37 AM GMT+5:30, May 10, 2025",
    "article": "JTA — Yeshiva University has revoked its recognition of a campus LGBTQ+ club just two months after approving it.\nThe Modern Orthodox flagship is alleging that the club, Hareni, breached the terms of the settlement agreement that allowed for its formation. Hareni’s lawyers claim that the school may be the one breaching the settlement and say statements by school leaders “threaten” LGBTQ students’ safety. The club has vowed to keep operating.\nYU’s decision to recognize Hareni in March — and settle related legal battles — marked a sharp pivot. For years, the school had fought in court to avoid recognition of the Pride Alliance, an LGBTQ support group that was unofficially launched in 2009 but never received formal recognition from the university’s administration.\nAt issue was Orthodox Judaism’s prohibition against homosexual relations. YU seeks to inculcate in its students the idea that they can live fully committed Orthodox Jewish lives while participating in modern society, and the question of welcoming LGBTQ students has strained that mission for years.\nBoth the school and the leaders of Hareni, who had previously led the Pride Alliance, depicted the March announcement as a resolution of the conflict. But within days of announcing recognition of the LGBTQ group, Yeshiva University president Rabbi Ari Berman said the values espoused by a typical “Pride” club are “antithetical” to the school. Rabbi Hershel Schachter, who leads YU’s rabbinical school, stated in March that he “emphatically rejects the ideology, lifestyle and behaviors which the LGBTQ term represents.”\nThis week, the conflict appeared to heat up again. Lawyers for the school and the club had exchanged dueling letters, and the decision to officially disband Hareni was announced Friday in an email to students from the dean of undergraduate Torah studies, Rabbi Yosef Kalinsky.\nIn the email, Kalinsky echoed Berman’s previous language, saying a pride club is “antithetical to the Torah values” of the university.\n“There is no place for such a club in yeshiva,” the email said. “As such, we are directing the Office of Student Life to discontinue this club.”\nThe decision to disband was made the day after a law firm representing Hareni sent a letter to the university expressing “deep concern about recent public statements by Yeshiva University’s senior leaders that display animus and hostility toward the University’s LGBTQ students,” according to the YU Observer, a Yeshiva University student newspaper. The letter accused the school of potentially violating its March settlement.\nThe letter claimed such statements “threaten the safety and well-being of LGBTQ students on campus.” The letter also cites an April 10 letter sent to YU alumni saying that the university required Hareni to include a “‘sexual morality’ disclaimer on all of its materials, communications, and publications.”\nYU says the club ran counter to the school’s outlook in word and deed.\nIn a written statement to the New York Jewish Week, the school alleged, “since the moment the club was announced, Hareni members, their legal counsel and public relations firm, have continuously made false and misleading statements that have sowed confusion regarding religious beliefs, and that are contrary to the goals that the approved guidelines set out for Hareni.”\nIn addition, YU’s lawyers sent a letter to Hareni’s lawyers claiming the club “violated” university rules, including posting Pride flags on its Instagram account, organizing social events and using YU’s name when hosting off-campus, unofficial events.\nThe school’s lawyers said the club “failed to include in their advertisements the notice that the Roshei Yeshiva required any time the Hareni name was used—i.e., referring to helping ‘students who seek to fully maintain traditional halachic standards of sexual morality …’”\nThe co-presidents of Hareni, Hayley Goldberg and Schneur Friedman, co-wrote an op-ed in the YU Observer on Tuesday, explaining the aims of the club. They added, “What we will not be doing as a club is writing the egregious statement, ‘This club is for students who seek to fully maintain traditional halachic standards of sexual morality as defined by the Shulchan Aruch’ on our posters and communications.” The Shulchan Aruch is a widely followed code of Jewish law.\n“Equating an identity with sexual immorality looks past us as a people,” wrote Goldberg and Friedman, who did not respond to a request for comment. “This statement sexualizes students and forgets every other aspect of them as a person. It reduces complex individuals to a single dimension, stripping them of their intellect, character, contributions to our community, and their spiritual journey.”\nIn a statement Friday, Hareni reiterated that the club has always operated “in accordance with the guidelines agreed upon and with deep respect for Halacha,” or Jewish law.\n”We remain committed to that path,” the statement said. “No attempt to silence or erase our existence will change that. If OSL [the Office of Student Life] responds to the call to ‘discontinue’ us, we will continue as though we were not. We will continue to hold events and safe spaces – albeit in an ‘unofficial’ manner.”\nRachael Fried, a YU alum and executive director of Jewish Queer Youth, a nonprofit that has provided support to LGBTQ Jews at YU, lamented the approach the school’s leadership has taken toward the students.\n“I’m incredibly proud of the students and their resilience that has brought us to where we are today, that we’re even having these conversations out loud,” she said.\n“It’s really disappointing to me that the leaders of Modern Orthodoxy feel so strongly to speak out against their very vulnerable and at-risk students in this way,” she added. “This notion that Pride and halacha, or Jewish law or Torah, are mutually exclusive is just not true.”",
