    "article": "While Donald Trump is skipping a visit to Israel during his ongoing Mideast travels, the ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza has been a significant part of discussions, as the US president dismissed claims that the Jewish state is being sidelined by his trip.\n“This is good for Israel,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, in response to a question about skipping a stop in Israel. “Having a relationship like I have with these countries… I think it’s very good for Israel.”\nThe US president added that the White House might deserve “the most credit” for the release on Monday from Gaza of Israeli-US hostage Edan Alexander, and said if it weren’t for the US, “probably none of the hostages would be living right now.”\nAsked aboard the flight whether Israel deserves any credit for the release of  Alexander, Trump said: “Well, they’ve been fighting a long time, they’re warring, and I think they deserve a lot of credit.\n“I think my people deserve a lot of credit. Maybe the most credit,” he added. “Look, [Alexander] wouldn’t be there. If it weren’t for us, he wouldn’t be living right now. Probably none of the hostages would be living right now. We probably have 20 that are living, that we’ll be getting out step by step.”\nAlexander was released Monday from Gaza in what was described as a goodwill gesture from the Palestinian terror group Hamas to Trump ahead of the US president’s visit to the region.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Wednesday afternoon that the premier held a series of lengthy discussions with Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and the Israeli hostage negotiating team, which Witkoff has joined in Doha.\nWitkoff, who headed from Tel Aviv to Doha on Tuesday, arriving shortly before Trump landed there, met with senior Qatari officials in the presence of families of hostages being held in Gaza, according to Al Jazeera, which said the meeting lasted two and a half hours.\nNetanyahu agreed to send a delegation to Doha after speaking with Trump on Monday and meeting with Witkoff and US Ambassador Mike Huckabee, stressing at the time that “the negotiations will take place only under fire.”\nSpeaking in Riyadh earlier Wednesday, Trump told Gulf leaders that he hopes for the “future of safety and dignity of the Palestinian people” in Gaza, but that it cannot happen under Hamas, who “delight in raping, torturing and murdering innocent people.”\nAttending a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council in the Saudi capital, Trump said he “greatly appreciates” the role of the Gulf countries in trying to “bring this terrible conflict to an end, including securing the release of American hostage Edan Alexander.”\n“We thought Edan was dead,” he said, adding that “ultimately, all hostages of all nationalities must be released as a stepping stone to peace.”\n“We thought Edan was dead.”\nUS President Donald Trump says Hamas cannot pursue peace while delighting in terror, as he thanks Gulf leaders for helping secure the release of American hostage Edan Alexander.#US #Gaza #Palestine #SaudiArabia #GCC pic.twitter.com/rhqbRUmcYb\n— Al Arabiya English (@AlArabiya_Eng) May 14, 2025\nSpeaking to journalists after the Gulf summit, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud declared that the US and Saudi Arabia “agree to end the war in Gaza and release all hostages.”\nHe said the US administration is willing to make “very courageous decisions” to push toward a ceasefire in Gaza, and “open up pathways to resolving the broader issues of Palestine,” including “moving toward, one hopes, a Palestinian state,” according to a New York Times report.\nThe US did not issue a similar statement regarding any agreements reached with the Saudis about the war in Gaza.\nAl-Saud also said: “We need to reach a ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible,” adding that “without a ceasefire in Gaza, it would be difficult to supply aid” to the enclave.\nTurkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a relentless critic of Israel, who joined Trump’s talks with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa via video, thanked Trump in a speech for “promising me that he will act to end the worsening humanitarian disaster in Gaza.”\nIsrael has threatened to launch its major military operation in Gaza once Trump leaves the Mideast on Friday if Hamas doesn’t agree to a hostage deal by then.\nNetanyahu told his coalition partners on Monday that despite sending a negotiating team to Doha, his position hasn’t changed. The negotiators only have a mandate to discuss what the premier has referred to as the “Witkoff proposal,” which would see as many as half of the hostages released in exchange for a weekslong ceasefire. During that truce, Israel is prepared to hold talks regarding a permanent end to the war, but will accept nothing less than Hamas agreeing to disarm and give up governing control of Gaza.\nHamas has said it is prepared to cede control of the Strip and agree to a yearslong truce with Israel that includes security guarantees. However, it has long refused demands that it permanently disarm.\nIt has also demanded guarantees from the mediators — potentially in the form of a binding UN Security Council resolution — that Israel be prevented from resuming the war if Hamas agrees to release hostages. Arab mediators say they face an uphill battle convincing Hamas to release hostages without assurances that Israel will end the war because the previous deal signed in January was supposed to see the sides enter talks regarding the terms of a permanent ceasefire, but Netanyahu largely refused to do so and the truce collapsed in March after its first of three phases.\nNurit Yohanan, Jacob Magid and Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.",

    "date": "Updated 08:24 PM GMT+5:30, May 15, 2025",
    "article": "A Palestinian terrorist opened fire on Israeli vehicles on Wednesday night in the northern West Bank, striking a pregnant woman who was en route to a hospital to deliver her baby, along with her husband, the military and medics said.\nThe woman, identified as Tzeela Gez, 30, was rushed to Petah Tikva’s Rabin Medical Center in critical condition.\nDuring efforts to save her life, doctors performed an emergency C-section to deliver her baby, the medical center said. The newborn was listed in serious condition and was transferred to Schneider Children’s Hospital within the compound, where doctors were working to save his life.\nShortly after dawn on Thursday, the hospital announced the woman’s death.\nGez, a mother of three, was in her ninth month of pregnancy and was heading from the family’s home in the Bruchin settlement to a hospital to give birth, local authorities said.\nHer husband, Hananel, who was driving the car, was lightly hurt, the hospital said after his condition was initially listed as serious.\nGez’s sister, Shaked Force, told the Ynet outlet that the pregnancy had been complicated.\n“She really put in an effort. She was always smiling and gave all her strength, always there for others. I don’t have the words to describe such an amazing character,” she said.\nForce said their parents “straight away knew of the disaster, knew that she was seriously injured, and when we got to the hospital, they couldn’t bear it.”\nTal Shahar Carmon, a close friend of Tzeela Gez, told the Kan public broadcaster about the “unbearably difficult” moment when Hananel explained to his three other children what had happened.\n“He told them that with Mom they traveled to bring the new baby, and on the way a terrorist shot at Mom, and Dad tried to save her, and they did everything, and they managed to save the baby but not Mom,” she recalled.\nGez, who was active on social media, worked as a trauma, anxiety, and relationships therapist. In the past, she posted videos and messages encouraging her followers to maintain their spirits despite the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.\n“Another moment I am grateful that I am breathing, that I am present and that I am here,” she wrote on Facebook in December 2023, two months after the devastating Hamas-led invasion of southern Israel, which caused the war. “From here, all I want to do is be active and spread light; even a small smile is spreading light.”\nThe Israel Defense Forces said it launched a manhunt for the terrorist who fired at several vehicles on Route 446 outside the Bruchin settlement, where the wounded couple is from.\nThe military said it dispatched troops and an Israeli Air Force drone for the manhunt, and that soldiers encircled and blocked the entrances to the adjacent Palestinian town of Bruqin.\nPalestinian media reported that some Palestinians were forced to sleep in their cars overnight because they were prevented from getting home.\nIDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir vowed to find the killers as he visited the scene.\n“This is a difficult and painful attack in which an Israeli civilian was killed on her way to a delivery room. I share in the deep sorrow of the family. We are engaged in broad fighting against terror in Judea and Samaria (West Bank), and we will continue,” Zamir says in remarks published by the IDF.\n“We will activate all our tools, and we will reach the murderers to bring them to justice,” he added.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was “deeply shocked by the horrific terrorist attack.”\n“This abhorrent incident precisely reflects the difference between us, who desire and bring life, and the reprehensible terrorists, whose goal is to kill us and destroy life,” he said in the statement released by his office.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz offered his condolences to the Gez family and prayers for the welfare of the newborn baby.\n“We will continue to fight terror with great force” in all areas of the West Bank and “will not allow it to raise its head,” he said.\nKatz said he had instructed the IDF to find those responsible for the attack and vowed “those who support and sponsor terror will pay a heavy price.”\nFar-right ministers in the coalition called for a military offensive in the West Bank similar to the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which has left most of the enclave in ruins.\nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X, “The burning pain and the cruelty of the sub-humans is incomprehensible.”\n“Just as we are flattening Rafah, Khan Younis, and Gaza, we must also flatten the terror nests” in the West Bank, he said.\nAllied far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir posted that the attack was “a painful reminder — the war is not only in Gaza.”\nHe then recalled a controversial remark he made in the past that “the right of the [Israeli] residents overrides that of the rights of Palestinian Authority residents to movement.”\nHe called on Netanyahu to instruct the IDF “to immediately and permanently” bring back all the checkpoints in the West Bank and to advance legislation to require a death sentence for terrorists.\nOpposition leader MK Yair Lapid offered his condolences to the Gez family and prayers for the injured baby.\n“Terror will not break us,” he posted to X, adding that he trusts the security forces to find “all those who had a hand in the terror attack and bring them to justice.”\nHead of the Shomron Regional Council Yossi Dagan said of Gez that she was “a devoted, loving, and smiling woman who only asked to live a quiet life–and she was murdered on her way to bring life [to the world].”\nDagan criticized security authorities, saying, “This is an area of repeated attacks, and the response by Israel can’t just be announcements to the media.”\nThe West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip ignited the war there.\nSince then, troops have arrested some 6,000 wanted Palestinians across the West Bank, including more than 2,350 affiliated with Hamas. According to the Palestinian Authority health ministry, more than 950 West Bank Palestinians have been killed in that time. The IDF says the vast majority of them were gunmen killed in exchanges of fire, rioters who clashed with troops or terrorists carrying out attacks.\nThere has also been a significant increase in settler violence against Palestinians since the start of the war.\nDuring the same period, 52 people, including Israeli security personnel, have been killed in terror attacks in Israel and the West Bank. Another eight members of the security forces were killed in clashes with terror operatives in the West Bank.",

    "date": "Updated 08:24 PM GMT+5:30, May 15, 2025",
    "article": "US President Donald Trump said Thursday that a deal was close on Iran’s nuclear program, voicing optimism about the chances for avoiding a military strike on Tehran’s sites.\n“We’re not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran,” Trump said in Qatar, the second of three stops during his four-day tour of the Middle East. “I think we’re getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this.”\n“So we’ll see what happens. But we’re in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace, and if we do that, it’ll be fantastic,” he added. It was not immediately clear what “long-term peace” meant in this context.\nThe US and Iran held their fourth round of indirect talks over the weekend, in their highest-level contact since the United States in 2018 pulled out of a previous 2015 nuclear deal.\nOil prices immediately dropped after Thursday’s comments by Trump, who said he was basing his optimism on new statements by Iran.\n“You probably read today the story about Iran. It’s sort of agreed to the terms,” Trump said.\nThe president did not specify which remarks he was referring to, but an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader said Wednesday that Tehran was willing to accept far-reaching, though not total, curbs on its nuclear program if the US were to immediately remove sanctions.\nUS officials have offered varying statements regarding whether they’ll accept a deal that allows Iran to maintain a limited enrichment program, though more recently have asserted that they won’t.\nIran, which openly seeks Israel’s destruction, has ramped up its enrichment of uranium to 60 percent purity, which has no peaceful application, and has obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities.\nTrump said Thursday that Iran should “say a big thank you” to Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who had pressed the US leader to avoid military action against his country’s giant neighbor.\n“Iran is very lucky to have the emir because he’s actually fighting for them. He doesn’t want us to do a vicious blow to Iran,” Trump said.\nThe previous evening, while attending a state dinner, Trump also expressed his desire for a peaceful resolution to Iran’s nuclear program, but reiterated that the US would take action in the absence of a deal.\n“The non-friendly is a violent course and I don’t want that,” Trump said on Wednesday, saying of the Iranians, “It’s their decision,” while urging Qatar to help reach an agreement.\n“It’s a perilous situation, and we want to do the right thing,” he said. “We want to do something that’s going to save maybe millions of lives. Because things like that get started and they get out of control.”\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Wednesday said Iran will not “bow to any bully,” in response to Trump’s criticism of Tehran during his Gulf tour.\n“He thinks he can come here, chant slogans and scare us. For us, martyrdom is far sweeter than dying in bed. You came to frighten us? We will not bow to any bully,” Pezeshkian said in comments broadcast live on state TV.\nDespite the talks, Washington has continued to impose sanctions targeting Iran’s nuclear program, its oil industry, and its ballistic missile program.\nAn adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Ali Shamkhani, told NBC News on Wednesday that Trump “talks about the olive branch, which we have not seen. It’s all barbed wire.”\nIn the interview, however, Shamkhani said “yes” to the proposition that, were the sanctions removed “immediately,” Tehran could agree to never develop nuclear weapons, give up stockpiles of highly enriched uranium and allow inspectors to nuclear sites, among other steps.\nThe United States on Wednesday unveiled fresh sanctions against six people and 12 firms — including several based in China and Hong Kong — for their support of Iran’s ballistic missile program.\nThe sanctions are aimed at organizations involved in “efforts to help the Iranian regime domestically source the manufacturing of critical materials needed for Tehran’s ballistic missile program,” according to the US Treasury Department.\n“The United States cannot allow Iran to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.\nTehran’s attempts to produce missiles and components domestically “represents an unacceptable threat to the United States and the stability of the region,” he added.\nThose sanctioned include three Chinese nationals — Qin Jinhua, Qin Dehui, and Wang Chao — who work for a China-based firm which has exported carbon fiber precursor materials to a sanctioned Iranian firm, and another Hong Kong-based company.\n“Iran remains heavily reliant on China to conduct its malign activities in the Middle East,” US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement.\n“This is another example of how the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) and China-based companies provide key economic and technical support to Iran and its proxies,” she added.\nOn Tuesday the United States announced fresh sanctions on Iranian oil sales to China, as Trump’s administration continues its “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran while backing ongoing nuclear talks.\nThe sanctions follow similar designations in recent weeks, at the same time as Washington and Tehran have stepped up nuclear talks.",

    "date": "Updated 08:24 PM GMT+5:30, May 15, 2025",
    "article": "Hostage negotiations kicked off in Doha on Wednesday with renewed energy and optimism from US mediators following Hamas’s release of American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, but an Israeli and an Arab official told The Times of Israel that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s refusal to accept proposals that commit Jerusalem to permanently ending the war in Gaza significantly limit the chances for success.\nStill, US special envoy to the Mideast Steve Witkoff is leaning hard on both Israel and Hamas to compromise and will stick with it through at least the Friday conclusion of US President Donald Trump’s Mideast trip, the Israeli official said, adding that the negotiations may extend further if they remain substantive but need a little more time.\nFor its part, Israel has pledged to launch a new massive military operation to reoccupy and hold onto the entire Strip indefinitely if Hamas does not agree to what it has called the “Witkoff proposal” by the end of Trump’s trip. This proposal envisions the release of as many as half of the remaining living hostages in exchange for a weekslong ceasefire, during which Israel would agree to hold talks regarding the terms of an end to the war without committing up front to such a result.\nHamas has pushed back on this framework, insisting on guarantees that the war will end before it releases additional hostages. It has pointed to Israel’s refusal to hold talks on a permanent ceasefire earlier this year, even though it had agreed to do so as part of the ceasefire inked in January, which collapsed after its first stage in March.\nThe terror group has proposed releasing all of the hostages at once in exchange for an end to the war, but Netanyahu has rejected this trade, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power. Successive polls have indicated that the premier is out of step with the majority of Israelis who back such a framework. But Netanyahu is also facing pressure from his far-right coalition partners, who have threatened to collapse the government if he were to end the war in exchange for the remaining 58 hostages — between 20 and 23 of whom are believed to still be alive.\nWhile Netanyahu has stuck to the “Witkoff proposal” from earlier this year, the Israeli official said the US envoy has moved away from this proposal and is instead pushing frameworks that more definitively include a permanent end to the war, while removing Hamas from power in Gaza.\nWitkoff held a phone call with Netanyahu for over two hours on Wednesday during which the US envoy sought to push the prime minister toward his new framework, but did not make significant progress, the Israeli official said.\nThe Arab official said Hamas has indicated willingness to show flexibility on the issue of disarmament if Israel agrees to end the war and withdraw its forces from Gaza. The terror group has already said it was prepared to transfer governing power to an independent committee of Palestinian technocrats.\nEgyptian and Qatari mediators have also been pushing Hamas to accept an initial ceasefire of several months — longer than the 45-day ceasefire that Netanyahu has said it is prepared to accept — that includes assurances from the mediators that they will ensure Israel remains at the negotiating table during that time to hash out the terms of a permanent end to the war and that it doesn’t resume fighting in the meantime, the Arab official said.\nQatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari appeared to confirm this effort, telling the local Al Araby Al Jadeed newspaper that the mediators’ current goal is to reach an initial ceasefire that is longer than the truce from earlier this year, which lasted six weeks, and provides an opportunity for the parties to reach additional agreements.\n“There are still challenges, but President Trump’s visit has given momentum to the negotiations,” al-Ansari said.\nAl-Ansari said that the new talks in Doha revolve around a US-backed proposal for an extended truce, the release of the remaining hostages and talks about the future of the Gaza Strip.\nLater Wednesday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told CNN that Israel’s sustained airstrikes this week send the signal that it is not interested in negotiating a ceasefire\nAmong the various meetings held in Qatar on Wednesday was a sit-down between Witkoff and senior Qatari negotiators, in the presence of several hostage families. The meeting was said by Al Jazeera to have lasted for some two-and-a-half hours.\nWitkoff was in the Gulf state along with Trump, who made Qatar the second stop on a three-country tour that started in Saudi Arabia on Monday and will end in the United Arab Emirates on Friday.\nMeanwhile, an American source denied an Arabic media report that Witkoff had met directly with senior Hamas officials.\nWhile no major breakthroughs were made by late Wednesday night, the Israeli and Arab officials said they expect US pressure to intensify over the next 48 hours.\nAn Israeli negotiating team made up of the former Shin Bet deputy chief, Netanyahu’s diplomatic adviser Ophir Falk and the government’s hostage point-man Gal Hirsch remains in Doha for continued discussions, though the Israeli official said their mandate is very limited. Witkoff understood this when he chose to pick up the phone and speak directly with Netanyahu on Wednesday, the official added.\nDuring a meeting Witkoff held with hostage families on Tuesday in Tel Aviv, one of the participants was recorded asking the US envoy why the US wasn’t pressuring Netanyahu to end the war. Witkoff could be heard responding that Israel is a sovereign country and that Washington wouldn’t force Jerusalem to make such a decision.\nChannel 12 quoted a senior Israeli official familiar with the hostage talks as having said that “the Americans have an attitude of ‘take it or leave it,’ or we’re gone. They are determined that whoever doesn’t go with them will lose a lot.”\nIsrael is also hoping that it will soon know the results of its Tuesday strike targeting Hamas’s Gaza leader Muhammad Sinwar, who it has viewed as an obstacle to the kinds of deals it has hoped to reach, the Israeli official said, expressing hope that his elimination would swing the power balance toward Hamas’s leadership abroad.\nIf Sinwar’s death is confirmed, the mediators are hoping that Israel will agree to put off its military operation in order to give time for Hamas to regroup and determine its decision-making framework, the Arab official said.\nNurit Yohanan contributed to this report.",

    "subheading": "Police in Antwerp looking for rabbis conducting the religious rite without medical license; Jewish group says raids part of larger campaign of intimidation against Jews in Belgium",
    "date": "Updated 06:52 PM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "Belgium police conducted a series of raids on Wednesday in Jewish homes in Antwerp looking for people illegally conducting ritual Jewish circumcisions, local officials said.\nPolice conducted raids on three locations in Antwerp’s Jewish Quarter and nearby Green Quarter seeking knives and other equipment used in circumcisions, according to local reports. No one was arrested.\nPolice are concerned that the brit milah ritual is being performed on Jewish baby boys by unlicensed mohels (people who perform circumcision) instead of professional doctors. The ritual is commonly done in a synagogue, not a medical institution, by people who may not have undergone receive comprehensive medical training.\n“The problem is that there is no clear law regarding circumcision at the moment,” Belgian MP Michael Freilich, the country’s only Orthodox Jewish lawmaker, told The Times of Israel.\nWhile there are no laws specifically regulating Jewish ritual circumcision, Belgium has laws mandating that all medical procedures must be performed by a licensed doctor.\nFreilich, who works with the European Union on Jewish matters in his position as the European Jewish Association’s diplomatic envoy for issues of antisemitism and Holocaust remembrance, is working on developing EU certification for mohels, but that is likely years away, he noted.\nUntil then, the situation is precarious for Jews looking to perform the biblically prescribed religious ritual with a traditional mohel.\n“This is a very sad day. On one hand, Jews must obviously respect the laws of their countries,” Freilich said. “On the other hand, there has been a policy until now of the government turning a blind eye to this issue. The problem is not that brit milah is not allowed; it’s that there needs to be a clearer law about who can perform the procedure. We need to work together to find a solution.”\nEuropean Jewish Association chairman Rabbi Menachem Margolin condemned the raids, calling them part of a larger campaign of intimidation against Jewish religious figures in Belgium.\n“Following the ban on ritual slaughter [in a 2019 law that requires that animals be stunned before they can be slaughtered for food], the harassment of mohels represents a further red line and a clear warning sign to Belgian Jews and the Belgian government,” Margolin said. “Any restriction on circumcision in Belgium would send a clear message to Belgian Jews that they are not welcome in the country.”\nBelgian MP Michael Freilich speaking to an audience in a synagogue in Belgium. (Courtesy)\nProsecutors in Antwerp, where most of Belgium’s approximately 30,000 Jews live, have been investigating illegal circumcisions since a renegade member of the Jewish community filed a series of complaints.\nIn November 2023, Rabbi Moshe Aryeh Friedman, an anti-Zionist activist from New York living in Antwerp, complained to police that six mohels were endangering children by using a controversial custom known as metzitzah b’peh in the circumcision process.\nThe practice involves mohels using their lips to suck blood from the penises of babies on whom they’d performed the Jewish ritual.\nThe controversial custom is thought to have caused the death of at least one child in New York in 2012 from herpes. Another outbreak among infants of Haredi families in New York occurred in 2017 and was attributed to metzitzah b’peh.\nThen, in September 2024, Friedman informed police that circumcisions were being performed without legal approvals, and a local television station reported on the issue, stoking local concern.\n“The only reason this is happening now is because of Friedman,” Freilich said. “That doesn’t mean it would never have happened, but he made it go much faster.”\nUnlicensed circumcisions are under increased scrutiny in Europe. Last summer, authorities in Ireland arrested a rabbi from London for allegedly performing circumcision without required medical credentials in what may be the first case in modern Europe of a rabbi arrested in connection with a brit milah.\nCircumcision is relatively uncommon among the general population of Europe, with only 10-20% of males having gone under the knife, compared to over 70% in the United States.\nMuslims generally undergo circumcision at a hospital, not in a religious ceremony, so the legislation is primarily a Jewish issue.\nMost countries do not have any specific legislation regarding circumcision, allowing the Jewish ritual to continue as a religious freedom without intervening, Freilich explained. Only Germany has a law specifically allowing non-medical practitioners to conduct the brit milah under appropriate medical and hygienic conditions.\nFreilich hopes to work with other European governments to adopt similar legislation allowing circumcision. He is also trying to encourage the EU to recognize certified mohels, he said.",

    "subheading": "Mysterious owners of the artifacts, possibly a mother and child, might have moved to Byzantine village in the Negev from Egypt or the Horn of Africa",
    "date": "Updated 04:39 PM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "Two enigmatic 1,500-year-old human figurines carved in rare ebony wood from India or Sri Lanka and likely made in Africa have been uncovered in the Negev, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced Wednesday, in conjunction with the publication of an academic paper on the findings in the IAA journal Atiqot.\nThe artifacts were unearthed in two late 6th/early 7th-century Christian tombs at the Tel Malhata archaeological site (northeastern Negev’s Arad Valley). According to Dr. Noé D. Michael from the IAA and the University of Cologne in Germany, one of the paper’s authors, the finding is unprecedented.\n“As far as we know, no such figurine had ever been identified in Israel, Jordan, and our region,” he told The Times of Israel over the phone.\nTel Malhata stands on a strategic location at the crossroads of two prominent ancient roads, one connecting Aila (near the bay of Aqaba, Jordan) with Jerusalem, and the other leading from the port of Gaza to the Dead Sea.\nThe artifacts were found in two graves next to each other. One contained the remains of a woman between the ages of 20 and 40, and the second was of a child who was six to eight years old.\n“We believe that since the tombs were close and presented the same kind of burial gifts, they were probably a mother and a child,” Michael said. “Unfortunately, we could not extract DNA remains from the bones to run a test.”\nIn addition to the ebony figurines, archaeologists also found three bone figurines.\n“Bone figurines are rare but not unique,” Michael noted.\nThe expert explained that many tombs from that period, especially those of women and children, presented burial gifts such as jewelry, glassware, coins, and other objects.\n“It is a well-known phenomenon in tombs from Byzantine times, which was attested in cemeteries also outside of Israel,” he said. “Men were only rarely buried with such gifts.”\nEbony is a high-end type of dark wood used for millennia to make furniture and luxurious items.\n“Experts at Tel Aviv University tested the wood and confirmed it came from India or Sri Lanka,” Michael said. “An ebony trade between Asia and Egypt and the Horn of Africa is attested starting from the 4th century CE.”\nThe researchers believe that the figurines were carved in Africa based on the facial features of the humans they depict.\nOne of the findings consists of a broken head approximately 1.5 centimeters high (0.6 inch) and less than 1 centimeter wide, portraying a woman. The other presents the head, chest, and upper arms of a man with long hair. Both have a hole that allowed their owners to wear the artifacts as necklaces.\n“The figurines present African facial features,” said Michael. “We believe that they depict people rather than gods, and therefore, our hypothesis is that they were ancestors of the deceased.”\nWhile no Christian symbols were found in the tomb, the position of the bodies, which were laid on their back with the heads pointing towards the west, has allowed the researchers to determine that the burials were Christians.\nMichael explained that the Horn of Africa was Christianized around the 6th century CE, roughly the same period when the woman and the child died.\n“For some reason, possibly related to trade, they probably moved north,” he said.\nThe cemetery at Tel Malhata was in use between the 3rd and the beginning of the 8th centuries CE. It presents several hundred graves, predominantly Christian but also some pagans from the late Roman period and Muslims from the early Islamic period (7th and 8th centuries CE.) However, no Jewish tombs have been identified. According to Michael, religious affiliation can be determined by both the findings in the grave and the position of the bodies – in the Islamic period, they pointed toward Mecca.\nIn the Roman Period, Tel Malhata featured a fortified structure that served as either a fortress or an agricultural estate with a protective tower. Briefly abandoned at the beginning of the 3rd century, it was resettled in the late 3rd/early 4th century. According to Michael, during the Byzantine period (324-336 CE), the town had as many as 5,000 residents, making it a significant center in the Negev.\n“However, we do not know much about the town, as it has not been properly excavated yet,” he said.\nThe cemetery is located south of the settlement.\n“It was first dug in the 1980s,” Michael said. “So far, archaeologists have excavated some 300 graves.”\nThe ebony figurines were found during the 2017 excavation season.\nWhile the mystery of the woman and child’s identity will likely never be solved, they were probably not the only nonnative people buried in the cemetery.\n“Since Tel Malhata was located on these important trade routes, many people passed through it,” Michael said. “We can see it in the numerous exotic findings we have unearthed, including some rare alabaster jewelry.”",

    "article": "JTA — Organizers of a community garden in Ridgewood in the New York borough of Queens that required members to oppose Zionism may now lose their city license.\nApplicants to the Sunset Community Garden were asked to sign a “statement of values” that included opposition to Zionism, antisemitism and “nationalist and/or racist beliefs.”\nIn an April 16 letter, the New York City Parks Department informed leaders of the garden that the statement had violated guidelines. The department told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that the application “required prospective members to affirm the group’s political and ideological viewpoints,” and added, ”Such litmus tests as a barrier to membership are not permitted, regardless of the ideological content.”\nThe garden had also gotten into a dispute with the city over the installation of a memorial for Cecilia Gentili, an activist for the rights of transgender people and sex workers.\n“We’ve been working with the Sunset Community Garden group since September 2024 to address several violations,” said Chris Clark, a press officer for NYC Parks, in an emailed statement. “Unfortunately, the group has not abided by the rules upheld by every other GreenThumb community garden even after Parks met with them and repeatedly offered solutions. As these issues have not been addressed, we have moved to terminate the license agreement.”\nClark said the termination had “nothing to do with members’ political beliefs or gender expression, but rather the repeated refusal by group leadership to address outstanding issues.”\nIf the license is revoked, the garden will remain open and will be managed under new operators.\nThe garden also faced scrutiny last September when local residents complained about the group’s anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian activism, which included a a teach-in with the “Poppies 4 Palestine” project and “Free Palestine” poster-making events, according to the New York Post.\nLast week, the Poppies 4 Palestine Instagram page posted a list of demands for the NYC Parks Department related to the dispute over the Gentili memorial.\nThe group asked the city to “prevent predatory tactics” and allow “clear due process for advocacy when gardens face harassment from GreenThumb [the city’s community garden program], Parks, elected officials, or other bad-faith actors (including racist, Zionist, transphobic, or otherwise oppressive forces).”\n“In repeated efforts to collaborate with GreenThumb, we’ve faced deliberate obstruction: unclear communication, harassment, threats, and ever-shifting demands that have now escalated to the erasure of community agreements,” said Poppies for Palestine in the post. “This isn’t negligence -— it’s a pattern of suppression. We refuse to let them bury our collective work under bureaucratic violence.”\nOne garden member, Nastazia Kielar, told the Gothamist web site that many in her community “see Zionism as a form of colonization still,” and that the garden was being treated unfairly.\nThe group told the Hell Gate site that complaints about the garden gained steam in a private Facebook group called “Zionist Brooklyn.”\n“They’re calling New York Parks Commissioner Sue Donoghue’s office to complain about us and alleging that we are teaching children to hate Jewish people,” a garden member identified only as Dana told Hell Gate. “It’s a weird witch-hunt type thing that’s happening -— the anti-woke mob, essentially.”",

    "article": "Palestinian media on Wednesday evening reported fresh strikes near a hospital in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip where the Israel Defense Forces targeted Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar in a massive strike the day before.\nAfter the original strikes on Tuesday targeted an underground command compound below the European Hospital where Sinwar was believed to be sheltering, the IDF has since bombed the area several times, in an apparent attempt to prevent anyone from approaching the tunnel beneath the medical center.\nOne strike on Wednesday morning near the hospital hit a bulldozer, according to Palestinian media, wounding several people.\nThe military has not commented on the additional strikes on the hospital.\nThe IDF has not yet confirmed whether Sinwar, the younger brother of former Hamas leader and October 7 terror mastermind Yahya Sinwar, was killed in the strike.\nThe military was also into the possibility that other senior Hamas officials, including the commander of the terror group’s Rafah Brigade, Mohammad Shabana, were with him at the time of the strike.\nContrary to several reports, Israeli officials believed that Hamas military wing spokesman Hudhaifa Kahlout, known by the nom de guerre “Abu Obeida,” was not with Sinwar in the bunker.\nMeanwhile, Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip since Wednesday morning killed over 100 people, according to tallies from the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry and civil defense agency, with at least 34 people reportedly killed in IDF strikes on Thursday morning alone. The figures could not be verified and do not differentiate between civilians and terror operatives.\nHamas civil defense spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP on Thursday morning that at least 13 people were “recovered from rubble” after a strike in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, while another 20 were killed in five strikes across the Gaza Strip, and one woman was killed in artillery shelling in southern Gaza.\nMeanwhile, a separate civil defense official, Mohammed al-Mughayyir, told AFP 80 people had been killed by Israeli strikes on Wednesday, including 59 in the north.\nAt least 50 people, including 22 children, were killed in strikes around northern Gaza’s Jabalia alone, according to hospitals and Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry.\nAFP footage from the aftermath of a strike in Jabalia showed mounds of rubble and twisted metal from collapsed buildings. Palestinians, including young children, picked through the debris in search of belongings.\nFootage of mourners in northern Gaza showed women in tears as they kneeled next to bodies wrapped in bloodstained white shrouds.\n“It’s a nine-month-old baby. What did he do?” one of them cried out.\nHasan Moqbel, a Palestinian who lost relatives, told AFP: “Those who don’t die from airstrikes die from hunger, and those who don’t die from hunger die from lack of medicine.”\nThe IDF on Wednesday had urged residents in part of a Gaza City neighborhood to evacuate, warning that its forces would “attack the area with intense force.”\nThe areas threatened by the evacuation warnings included several schools and the al-Shifa hospital, the Strip’s largest, according to a map published by the IDF.\nWitnesses and medics said shortly after the evacuation orders Israeli planes carried several airstrikes against targets within Gaza City.\nThe IDF had no immediate comment, and said it was trying to verify the reports.\nمتابعة| سلسلة غارات إسرائيلية عنيفة تستهدف محيط مستشفى غزة الأوروبي شرقي خانيونس، جنوب قطاع غزة. pic.twitter.com/l5CWvQe2p1\n— المركز الفلسطيني للإعلام (@PalinfoAr) May 14, 2025\nThe war in Gaza began with the Hamas assault on October 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages.\nOver 52,000 people have since been killed in the Strip, according to the Hamas health ministry’s unverifiable tally, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.",

    "article": "Sixty-one percent of Israelis support normalizing ties with Saudi Arabia and expanding the Abraham Accords in 2025, according to a poll published Tuesday, coinciding with US President Donald Trump’s first Middle East tour.\nThe survey, conducted by Ipanel on behalf of the Coalition for Regional Security, found that just 4.7% of respondents opposed Saudi normalization, while 33.9% said they neither support nor oppose such a move.\nThe survey measured Israeli public attitudes on regional diplomacy, the war in Gaza, and a potential US-led initiative based on a representative sample of 954 Israeli adults, including both Jews and Arabs.\nThe poll was released as Trump began a four-day trip to the Middle East, kicking off in Saudi Arabia before continuing to the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Speaking at an investment summit in Riyadh, the president said Tuesday that it is his “dream” for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, though he acknowledged that Riyadh would do so in its own time.\n“It’s my fervent hope, wish and even my dream that Saudi Arabia… will soon be joining the Abraham Accords,” he said.\nThe poll suggests that many Israelis share that sentiment. When asked whether normalization with Saudi Arabia would strengthen Israel’s security, economy and regional standing, and weaken Iran, 67% of respondents said it would contribute significantly. Another 16% said it would contribute little or not at all, while 17.1% said they didn’t know.\nSupport for normalization was also consistent across political lines. Among Israelis who voted for the parties in the government coalition, 60% said they support normalization (compared to 61% of all respondents), and 65% said it would contribute significantly to Israel’s strategic interests (compared to 67% overall).\nThe poll also addressed the impact of Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza on ties with Saudi Arabia and beyond. A majority — 53% — said that occupying and controlling the Gaza Strip would somewhat or greatly harm the chances of reaching an agreement with Saudi Arabia and cooperating with moderate countries in the region. Just 12.8% said it would not harm those efforts, while 34.3% said it would neither help nor hinder them.\nA substantial majority — 68.9% — said they would back a Trump-led regional political initiative that included the return of all Israeli hostages, an end to the war in Gaza, normalization with Saudi Arabia, a pathway toward separation from the Palestinians, and the formation of a US-led regional security coalition against Iran. Only 9.7% said no, while 21.5% were neutral.\nUpon publication of the poll, the Coalition for Regional Security — a group of over 100 senior Israeli figures from the military, political, business, and academic sectors — called on the government to act quickly.\n“This survey serves as an urgent wake-up call to the Israeli government: enough with political intransigence — get on board the regional train now,” the group said in a statement.\n“This is the moment to seize the historic opportunity presented by President Trump to reshape the Middle East and strengthen Israel’s security. History will not forgive those who miss the chance to bring regional stability through strategic alliances and courageous partnerships that are forming at this very moment. The Israeli people want this — now the government must say ‘yes’ to President Trump. If we keep hesitating — we will be left behind.”\nDuring his visit in Riyadh, Trump signed a host of economic and bilateral cooperation agreements with Saudi Arabia.\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto Saudi ruler, has already committed to some $600 billion in new Saudi investment in the US, but Trump teased that $1 trillion would be even better. The agreements included a mammoth arms deal described by the White House as the largest “in history” between the allies, worth nearly $142 billion.\nTrump also announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria’s new government, after being pressed by bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nThe US president will next travel to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in his first Middle East tour, notably skipping Israel.",

    "article": "An earlier version of this Editor’s Note was sent out Wednesday in ToI’s weekly update email to members of the Times of Israel Community. To receive these Editor’s Notes as they’re released, join the ToI Community here.\nNobody had doubted US Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff’s immense personal commitment to securing the release of all the hostages from Hamas captivity in Gaza.\nBut he has proved it multiple times in the past few days. He oversaw the indirect contacts with Hamas that secured the release of the last living hostage with American citizenship, 21-year-old IDF soldier Edan Alexander. He flew to Israel to greet Alexander on his release on Monday, went to visit him and his family in the hospital on Tuesday, and put him on the phone with US President Donald Trump in Riyadh and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nExtraordinarily, he gave Alexander the Star of David necklace that his own son Andrew used to wear before his tragic death in 2011 and that he has reportedly worn himself ever since, and told the freed hostage that he “would be doing a great honor to my son if you keep wearing this.”\nHe and Trump’s hostages envoy Adam Boehler then spent over an hour and a half meeting with families of the remaining 58 hostages still held by Hamas, reiterating the Trump administration’s commitment to getting them all freed. Relative after relative emerged from the meeting with a little of their 586 days of agony eased. “It was a calming meeting,” Meirav Gilboa-Dalal, whose son Guy is among the living hostages, said on Wednesday morning. “We met a man who understands our pain.”\nIn an audio clip from the meeting, Witkoff can be heard saying that if he cannot facilitate a diplomatic solution to the hostage crisis, “it will be one of the worst failures that I can ever endure in my life.”\nWitkoff is in Doha right now attempting to arrange precisely such a solution, on behalf of a president who keeps restating that the US is determined to secure the release of all the hostages. Netanyahu has dispatched a delegation, too, but reportedly with little room for maneuver in negotiations. The prime minister said on Tuesday that were Hamas to offer “to release 10 more” living hostages, that would be “fine. We’ll take them… But there will be no situation where we stop the war.\n“A temporary ceasefire — fine. But we’re going all the way,” he stressed. “In the coming days, we’ll go in with full force to complete the operation. Completing the operation means subduing Hamas. It means destroying Hamas.”\nWitkoff on Tuesday hailed Netanyahu’s crucial role in the process that enabled Alexander’s release, assuring the prime minister in a phone conversation that the way he “allowed the negotiations to operate” was “in large part the reason that Edan is home with his family today.” And while Trump has been saying he is working to get the Gaza war ended “as quickly as possible,” he has reportedly not been directly pressing Netanyahu to do so in order to secure the freedom of the remaining hostages — a Hamas condition that Netanyahu has repeatedly made clear he will not accept, because it would mean Hamas surviving, rebuilding, and preparing to attack again.\nBut the US president, as he is proving almost minute by minute in his current fast-paced Middle East trip, is an insistent deal-maker. And whether he’s still broadly empathetic to Netanyahu’s concerns or not particularly bothered by some of them, he’s moving ahead on a whole range of vital regional issues without including Israel on his regional itinerary, without arranging for an Israeli presence at his critical meetings, and without heeding Israeli concerns in an expanding number of his agreements.\nBefore setting out on his trip, Trump signed a truce with the Houthis two days after they launched a missile that struck Ben Gurion Airport, prompting foreign airlines to flee.\nHe dramatically deepened US-Saudi relations, with Israel out of the loop — telling Saudi leaders on Tuesday that while it is his dream for them to join the Abraham Accords with Israel, “you’ll do it in your own time.” Left unspoken was his recognition that Saudi Arabia will not normalize ties with an Israeli government, under Netanyahu, that refuses to set out even a theoretical pathway to Palestinian statehood.\nHe signed an unprecedentedly large arms deal with Riyadh, worth some $142 billion, doubtless to Jerusalem’s dismay (especially if Israel’s air supremacy is undermined). And he is reportedly discussing a deal regarding the Saudis’ desire for a civil nuclear program, which opposition leader Yair Lapid warned on Wednesday would trigger a Middle East nuclear race.\nHe is determined to seal a deal with Iran that, given the US zig-zagging on whether this will require the destruction of all of the regime’s nuclear facilities, has Jerusalem in panic mode.\nOver objections from Jerusalem, he’s lifted all sanctions on a Syrian leadership that Israel understandably regards as a terrorist regime unless or until proven otherwise, and asked President Ahmed al-Sharaa to normalize relations with Israel and join the Abraham Accords.\nAs I write, he’s just arrived in Qatar, the Hamas-funding, Hamas-hosting mediator that’s allegedly been paying some of Netanyahu’s aides to lobby on its behalf, and that Trump has insisted is “absolutely trying to help” resolve the hostage-war crisis.\nEvery one of these moves has vast implications for Israeli security, economy and the daily well-being of its people. Any Israeli government would have tried to influence and amend Trump’s rapid deal-making steps toward the Houthis, the Syrians, the Saudis and the Iranians. But Israel has been largely marginalized as Trump has advanced them.\nIt was being speculated in Jerusalem on Tuesday evening that Trump is angry with Netanyahu for having sought to push him toward a military strike on Iran, when he has been advocating diplomacy. It was also being suggested that Trump has concluded that Israel is simply no longer as central to American interests in the region.\nOpposition leader Lapid argued that Netanyahu had denied Israel a seat in Riyadh because of the far-right-driven policies of his coalition. “Netanyahu had two options,” said Lapid on Wednesday afternoon. “Either to do something in Khan Younis for the sixth time, or to be in Riyadh — to sit at the head of a table in Saudi Arabia and be part of agreements on a scale we’ve never known, bringing historic change to the Middle East. And he chose a military operation in Khan Younis” — targeting Hamas’s Gaza leader Mohammad Sinwar.\n“I’m in favor of eliminating the leaders of Hamas,” Lapid went on, referring to Tuesday’s IDF strike, “but for the national interest, we had to be in Saudi Arabia. And we’re not in Saudi Arabia because [Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners Bezalel] Smotrich and [Itamar] Ben Gvir won’t allow it. (The two party leaders insisted on March’s return to war in Gaza, after only the first of the three envisaged phases of the hostage-ceasefire deal finalized by Witkoff in January, and they are even more adamant than Netanyahu in their opposition to any notion of Palestinian statehood.) Said Lapid: “This is causing harm for generations and harm to our relations with the Americans.”\nFor now, with Trump and Netanyahu’s Israel, it appears to be less a case of “he’s not that into you,” and more a case of “I’m moving ahead, with or without you.” With this trip, Trump is soaringly elevating the Gulf states, and that, by definition, means Israel’s regional importance is reduced in the president’s considerations.\n“The transformation that has occurred under the leadership of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed [Bin Salman] has been truly extraordinary,” the president enthused of Saudi Arabia in his main address on Tuesday night, calling the crown prince the US’s strongest partner. “We have great partners in the world, but we have none stronger and nobody like the gentleman that’s right before me,” Trump said of Bin Salman, looking at the crown prince. “He’s your greatest representative… I like him too much… Great guy.”\nImplicit in Trump’s admiration for progress in the Gulf is a demotion of Israel as the go-to regional cutting-edge powerhouse, the prime innovator, the tech pioneer, the smart destination for investment. Right now, you can barely even fly here.\nIt is not clear how all this will affect Steve Witkoff’s efforts in Doha. Gilboa-Delal said Wednesday that the envoy told the families the US can’t decide for Israel on the terms it will accept to bring back hostages. But the US president has untold military, diplomatic and economic leverage he can bring to bear should he choose to.\nThe fact is that Trump is forging ahead with a whole slew of deals and alliances radically impacting Israel — and in so doing, he is already determining core aspects of Israel’s security and geopolitical future.\nHe said on the plane to Qatar that the US having good ties with the Gulf states “is very good for Israel.” Potentially, that is true, but only if the Israeli leadership proves capable of utilizing those ties. The longer Israel is not seated at the main table alongside the US president, metaphorically and literally, the narrower Israel’s room for maneuver.",

    "subheading": "Freed hostage’s aunt says he received more food following US election, while a report claims dual citizen was also moved to a nicer tunnel alongside senior Hamas officials",
    "date": "Updated 11:49 PM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "Freed hostage Edan Alexander’s conditions in captivity improved following the inauguration of US President Donald Trump in January, according to a family member.\nAlexander’s aunt, Sharon Senyor, told the Ynet news site on Wednesday that “he said that since Trump took power his conditions improved. From the moment they started to talk about him, they gave him more food so that he would gain weight.”\nYnet also reported, citing conversations Alexander had with others since his release on Monday, that following Trump’s inauguration, the freed hostage was moved to a “VIP tunnel” with senior Hamas officials in order to both serve as a human shield and provide him with further protection due to his American citizenship.\nThis echoes comments Alexander reportedly made during his phone conversation with Trump on Tuesday. According to Channel 12 news, Alexander, when asked by the US president how Hamas had treated him, answered: “Since you got elected, my conditions improved dramatically. There are tons of cameras and people around me right now — I can’t share much at the moment. We’ll talk in private.”\nAlthough reports had circulated that Alexander might fly to Doha on Wednesday to meet with Trump, his family said following his release that he required further medical treatment before leaving the country, and expects to meet the US president in Washington in the future.\nAlexander, 21, the last living hostage with American citizenship, was freed from Gaza on Monday, after 584 days in captivity, following indirect talks between the US and Hamas. The negotiations sidelined Israeli officials, who were updated only after the deal was struck.\nA dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, Alexander was serving in the IDF’s Golani Brigade at the time of his abduction. Hamas kidnapped him from his base near the Gaza border community of Nirim, known as the White House post, during its October 7 onslaught.\nHe is the first male IDF soldier to be freed by Hamas since the start of the war. The other hostages with US citizenship still remaining in the Strip have all been declared dead by Israeli officials — soldiers Itay Chen and Omer Neutra and married couple Judith Weinstein and Gadi Haggai.\nTrump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, pressed heavily on Hamas and Israel to agree to a January ceasefire that went into effect even before Trump took office. Pressure and threats from Trump are considered to have played a significant role in ultimately bringing the deal to fruition after more than a year of stalled talks.\nDuring that deal, Hamas freed 30 hostages, including five Thai nationals, and returned the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives. Two of those freed, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Keith Siegel, also had US citizenship, and Siegel met with Trump in the White House in March.\nIn March, Hamas offered to free only Alexander and the bodies of the other hostages with US citizenship, a move rejected by Israel and later also rejected by Witkoff.\nAlexander told soldiers who received him in the Strip that Hamas subjected him to harsh torture for weeks on end and kept him in a cage over a long period of time with his hands and feet bound, the Kan public broadcaster reported.\nIn remarks to reporters on Tuesday evening, his parents, Yael and Adi, spoke of Edan’s suffering during more than 19 months of captivity.\nYael said her son suffered from a lack of water, food and other aid. He also described the terror he experienced when the IDF would strike Gaza, destroying buildings.\n“The strikes and bombs made him think that every moment was about to be his last one,” she said. “Edan, my hero, you returned from the horror. But other hostages are still living through that threat, they are still living in that hell. My heart has returned to beating, but they still need to return home.”\nAccording to the Channel 12 news network, Alexander was severely beaten during the early period of his captivity, and he returned to Israel with flea bites and bruises all over his body.\nIsrael believes that 58 hostages are still being held by terror groups in Gaza, including 35 confirmed dead by Israeli authorities and another three about whom Israel has expressed severe concern. The 35 bodies include that of an IDF soldier who was killed in 2014.",

    "subheading": "Meeting between leaders set for Wednesday; sources say Damascus may offer talks on normalizing relations with Israel under Abraham Accords",
    "date": "Updated 09:56 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "US President Donald Trump said Tuesday he will move to normalize relations and lift sanctions on Syria’s new government to give the country “a chance at peace.”\nTrump is set to meet Wednesday in Saudi Arabia with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, the onetime insurgent who last year led the overthrow of former leader Bashar al-Assad. He said the effort at rapprochement came at the urging of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi de facto ruler, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n“There is a new government that will hopefully succeed,” Trump said of Syria, adding, “I say good luck, Syria. Show us something special.”\nSyria’s Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani said Tuesday that Trump’s decision to lift sanctions was a “pivotal turning point for the Syrian people, as we move toward a future of stability, self-sufficiency and genuine reconstruction after years of destructive war.”\nSharaa will be the first Syrian leader to meet an American president since the late Hafez al-Assad met Bill Clinton in Geneva in 2000.\nIt was a major boost for the Syrian president, who at one point was imprisoned in Iraq for his role in the insurgency following the 2003 US-led invasion of the Arab country. Sharaa was named president of Syria in January, a month after a stunning offensive by insurgent groups led by Sharaa’s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, stormed Damascus, ending the 54-year rule of the Assad family.\nAccording to the London Times, citing unnamed security sources, Sharaa may use the meeting to offer talks on normalizing relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords.\nA US security source confirmed the possibility of Damascus joining the accords, with the United Arab Emirates as a mediator. Sharaa confirmed last week that Abu Dhabi is already acting as an intermediary between Israel and Syria, with talks focusing on security and intelligence matters and confidence-building between the two countries, which have no official relations.\nThe source added that Washington and Gulf countries are seeking to pull Syria away from Iranian influence. Tehran, sworn to Israel’s destruction, propped up the former Assad regime throughout the bloody Syrian civil war.\nThe US has been weighing how to handle Sharaa since he took power in December. Gulf leaders have rallied behind the new government in Damascus and will want Trump to follow, believing it is a bulwark against Iran’s return to influence in Syria.\nThen-president Joe Biden left the decision to Trump, whose administration has yet to formally recognize the new Syrian government.\n“The president agreed to say hello to the Syrian President while in Saudi Arabia tomorrow,” the White House said before Trump’s remarks.\nThe comments marked a striking change in tone from Trump and put him at odds with Israel, which has been deeply skeptical of Sharaa’s extremist past and cautioned against swift recognition of the new government.\nFormerly known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, Sharaa joined the ranks of al-Qaida insurgents battling US forces in Iraq after the US-led invasion in 2003. He still faces a warrant for his arrest on terrorism charges in Iraq, and the US once offered $10 million for information about his whereabouts because of his links to al-Qaida.\nIn 2011, Sharaa came back to his home country, where he led the branch of al-Qaida that was known as the Nusra Front. He later changed the name of his group to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and cut links with al-Qaida.\nSyria has had fraught relations with Washington since the days of the Cold War, when Damascus maintained close links with the Soviet Union and later became Iran’s closest ally in the Arab world.\nLondon-based Syrian analyst Ibrahim Hamidi said Trump’s meeting with Sharaa marks a “strategic shift” in the country, with Iran forced to leave and Russia, which also backed Assad and now gives him sanctuary, weakened.\n“The Syrian-American meetings in Riyadh open the gate for the two sides to start discussing disagreements and issues between them with an atmosphere of dialogue,” said Hamidi, editor-in-chief of the Arabic magazine Al Majalla. “This is important.”",

    "date": "Updated 12:45 AM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "CANNES, France (AP) — One hundred years after Charlie Chaplin made dinner rolls dance and ate his shoe like it was a fine meal, “The Gold Rush” has been vividly brought back to life in a new restoration that premiered Tuesday at the Cannes Film Festival.\nOn the opening day of its 78th edition, Cannes debuted a 4K restoration of “The Gold Rush,” one of Chaplin’s most beloved silent masterpieces. The screening, held just before the festival’s official opening ceremony, was part of a new day-one tradition for restored films, festival director Thierry Fremaux said before the screening at Cannes’ Debussy Theatre.\nYears in the making, this “Gold Rush” pristinely restores Chaplin’s Tramp to all his downtrodden glory. The 1925 Alaskan frontier comedy may be marking its centenary, but it looks bracingly fresh in the restoration carried out by La Cineteca di Bologna.\nThe restoration was more complicated than most because it included an extensive search for any missing footage. In 1942, Chaplin edited the film and re-released it with sound effects, music and narration. That version landed two Oscar nominations, but the restoration sought to get as close to the 1925 original as possible.\nIn “The Gold Rush” Chaplin’s lone prospector ambles through the snowy Alaskan wilds in pursuit less of gold than some food and perhaps companionship. His antic, cliff-dangling struggles make up much of the film’s deft slapstick, but the Little Tramp’s humble, sweet hopes for romance greatly exceed his strike-it-rich ambitions.\nThe film’s premiere drew two grandchildren of Chaplin: Kiera Chaplin and Spencer Chaplin.\n“What to say about ‘The Gold Rush?’ said Spencer Chaplin. “It was his biggest production to date. He built the set — it was almost like a tourist attraction in LA at the time. He built the mountains.”\nThe screening in Cannes drew a packed house in one of Cannes’ largest theaters, a crowd that the Chaplin descendants warmly surveyed.\n“Our grandfather would be really proud to see this, a hundred years later, to see all you here and interested in seeing the film,” said Kiera Chaplin.\n“The Gold Rush” will roll out in theaters worldwide on June 26 in a release organized by mk2 Films.",

    "article": "A ballistic missile launched at Israel by the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen was successfully intercepted by air defenses on Tuesday evening, the military said.\nA 40-year-old woman in Holon was taken by paramedics to Wolfson Medical Center with lower body injuries sustained when she tripped on her way to a bomb shelter, and a 65-year-old woman in Ramat Gan who was lightly injured in the head on the way to a shelter was taken to Ichilov Medical Center, the Magen David Adom ambulance service said.\nSirens had sounded across central Israel and the Jerusalem area. Preceding the sirens by around a minute, an early warning was issued to residents, alerting civilians of the long-range missile attack via a push notification to their phones.\nHours later, another ballistic missile launched from Yemen, apparently aimed at Israel, fell short far from the country, according to an Israeli defense source.\nThe military identified the launch, but no sirens sounded in Israel because the missile did not pose a threat.\nA missile fired from Yemen also fell short of the country on Monday, a defense source said.\nThe attacks came a week after Israel carried out two days of heavy sorties targeting infrastructure controlled by the Houthis in response to a missile that struck Ben Gurion Airport. After Ben Gurion was hit, most foreign airlines suspended flights to Israel.\nHungary-based low-cost airline Wizz Air said Tuesday it expects to resume flight services to and from Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport on May 15, after suspending services following the attack.\nThe fiery Israeli reprisals destroyed the international airport in the capital, Sanaa, and caused heavy damage to a port in Hodeida and several power stations and a cement factory, officials said.\nThe Sanaa airport will resume operations starting Wednesday, the facility’s general said Tuesday.\nOn Sunday, the IDF issued an “urgent” evacuation warning to the three Houthi-controlled ports in western Yemen, though no strikes were reported to follow.\nThe Houthis — whose slogan calls for “Death to America, Death to Israel, [and] a Curse on the Jews” — first began attacking Israel and maritime traffic in November 2023, a month after the October 7 Hamas massacre.\nThe Houthis held their fire when a ceasefire was reached between Israel and Hamas in January 2025. By that point, they had fired over 40 ballistic missiles and dozens of attack drones and cruise missiles at Israel, including one that killed a civilian and wounded several others in Tel Aviv in July, prompting Israel’s first strike in Yemen.\nSince March 18, when the IDF resumed its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis in Yemen have launched 31 ballistic missiles and at least 10 drones at Israel. Several of the missiles have fallen short.\nThe sirens warning of missile attacks have sent hundreds of thousands of Israelis rushing to shelters at all hours of the day and night.",

    "date": "Updated 08:25 PM GMT+5:30, May 15, 2025",
    "article": "The BBC is facing calls to sack Gary Lineker rather than letting him leave on his own terms, after the football pundit shared a video on his social media claiming to “explain” Zionism, featuring an image of a rat.\nLineker, the BBC’s highest paid broadcaster, shared the video, titled “Zionism explained in less than two minutes”, on Instagram. It was initially posted by a group called “Palestine Lobby” and features a clip with comments from Diana Buttu, a former spokesperson for the PLO.\n“They take the land, claim that its theirs and then they make concessions on land that doesn’t actually belong to them”, Ms Buttu states in the clip, going on to say that “the Zionist movement and Zionism on the ground is the idea of creating not only a Jewish state but at the expense of the indigenous Palestinian population. What Zionism is, is the idea of privileging and giving exclusive rights to one group of people at the expense of another group of people…there isn’t a single Zionist who’s able to say that they actually believe that Palestinians have the exact same rights as Israelis who are living in that country.”\nGet The Jewish News Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFree Sign Up\nThe rat emoji appears prominently alongside the title of the video.\nA spokesperson for the Board of Deputies said: “The BBC has allowed the situation with Gary Lineker to continue for far too long. He has caused great offence with this video – particularly with his egregious use of a rat emoji to illustrate Zionists. BBC should ask him to leave now rather than allowing him to dictate his own terms.”\nAlex Hearn, co-director of Labour Against Antisemitism, said: “Gary Lineker has been sharing increasingly extreme content as his fixation has grown, and it was apparent that it was only a matter of time before he crossed the line.\n“Sharing content that uses a rat to demonise the very idea of a Jewish nation state draws directly from Nazi propaganda. It is unfathomable that this is apparently “hateful conduct” on X, but acceptable conduct for the BBC.\n“Lineker made ill-judged comparisons with Germany in the 1930s to further his political point of view, but now he is sharing ideas about Jews popularised in 1930’s Germany. When will enough disrepute be enough for the BBC? It’s time for Lineker to go.”\nEtan Smallman, who originally shared information about Lineker’s actions on Twitter, also referenced the 1930’s analogy, which was used by Lineker in 2023 to describe the then-Home Secretary’s statements on stopping people crossing the English Channel in small boats.\nDavid Hirsh, academic director and CEO of the London Centre for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism, said: “We know Gary Lineker. Nice guy. Never got a yellow card. Our hearts soared when he scored for England. Speaks out against Brexit and against racism. He’s one of us. What absurd over-reach when Jews called him an antisemite! How could he be, he’s a good guy? Now he’s sharing posts that demonise the overwhelming majority of Jews as rats.\n“What’s happening here is that for most liberal Brits, being in the same tribe as Lineker is the important thing. In order to achieve that, they have to say either that this is legitimate, or this is just an understandable exaggeration or stumble: “sure, he shouldn’t have said that, but he’s a footballer not a politician, and this is just his clumsy way of siding with the victims; to accuse the nice guy is a disgraceful way of trying to change the subject.”\nHirsh continued: “The truth is that ‘good people’ in our own political tribe are sometimes antisemitic.”\nLineker has regularly commented on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over the last 18 months. Last year he shared a call for Israel to be banned from international sport, before deleting it from his social media. More recently, he criticised the BBC’s decision to remove a documentary on Gaza found to feature the son of a senior Hamas official, stating that the Corporation had “capitulated to lobbying that they get a lot”\nIn an interview with the New Statesman in December, Lineker stated that he was “not in the slightest bit antisemitic”, but was rather “anti-Israel government”.\nThe post has since been removed from Mr Lineker’s Instagram, but it is unclear whether the BBC will be taking action.\nDanny Cohen, former Director of BBC Television and Controller of BBC One, said: “Gary Lineker appears to have shared content about the Jewish State which echoes 1930’s Nazi propaganda. This is utterly grim. The BBC’s Director General Tim Davie has a simple question to answer: does he tolerate the BBC’s flagship presenters sharing content that has historically been used as an anti-Semitic slur?”\nLast November the BBC confirmed that Mr Lineker would be leaving the BBC’s flagship football show, Match of the Day, at the end of the Premier League season, but confirmed that he would be hosting the Corporation’s coverage of the 2026 World Cup.\nHe is also one of the founders of the Goalhanger podcast production and distribution company, featuring popular podcasts including The Rest is History, The Rest is Politics, Empire and The Rest is Entertainment.\nThe BBC has been approached for comment.\nThank you for helping to make Jewish News the leading source of news and opinion for the UK Jewish community.

    "date": "Updated 02:26 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "Freed American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander spoke to US President Donald Trump over the phone on Tuesday in a call made on the phone of US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who arrived at the hospital to visit him.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also spoke by phone with Alexander, his office said, and released a video of the premier during the conversation, during which the former hostage said he was weak, but recovering after his ordeal.\nAlexander was released from captivity in the Gaza Strip on Monday in what has been described as a goodwill gesture from the Palestinian terror group Hamas to Trump ahead of the president’s visit to the region.\nWitkoff and Alexander “had the opportunity to speak with [President Trump], whose leadership made this possible. We remain committed to bringing every last hostage home,” the envoy said in a post from his office on X.\n“I was honored to meet Edan Alexander today and welcome him home. After months in captivity, the world is inspired by his courage and resilience. His return gives hope to so many,” Witkoff added.\nIn his own conversation with Alexander, Netanyahu spoke of the national celebration at his release and asked about his welfare.\n“It is so good to hear you,” Netanyahu said.\n“Amazing, unbelievable,” Alexander was heard responding.\nNetanyahu asked Alexander how he is feeling, to which the latter responded, “Okay. Weak. Slowly, slowly, we’ll get back to the way things were before. It is just a matter of time.”\nNetanyahu told Alexander to hug his parents, who were with him during the call, and that “all of Israel is hugging the three of you. Today we are all one family.”\nDuring the call, Netanyahu also spoke with Witkoff, who praised the Israeli prime minister for his role in enabling the release, which has been seen as a Trump administration achievement rather than an Israeli one.\n“We are very happy for the help that you and President Trump gave us,” Netanyahu told Witkoff, adding that other Israeli soldiers are poised to “take action” if the remaining hostages are not released.\n“Mr. Prime Minister, I told Edan and his family everything that you have done to make this possible over the last several days,” Witkoff responded.\nDescribing the negotiations for Alexander’s release as “tense,” Witkoff said it was “critical” that Netanyahu had “allowed” the talks between the US and Hamas — which Israel was not part of — to take place.\n“That’s a large part of the reason that Edan is home with his family today,” Witkoff said.\nWitkoff mediated that phone call, too, according to a Ynet report. The Prime Minister’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation of the details.\nI was honored to meet Edan Alexander today and welcome him home. After months in captivity, the world is inspired by his courage and resilience. His return gives hope to so many. We also had the opportunity to speak with @POTUS, whose leadership made this possible. We remain… pic.twitter.com/9rninnXSJy\n— Office of the Special Envoy to the Middle East (@SE_MiddleEast) May 13, 2025\nLater, Witkoff, accompanied by US special envoy on hostages Adam Boehler, headed to Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square to meet with the families of other hostages still held in Gaza. Boehler flew to Israel with Alexander’s mother on Sunday as they rushed to be in the country in time for his release.\n“I hope this is a beacon of hope for everybody else,” Witkoff said of the remaining Gaza hostages.\n“Thank God for President Trump. And, by the way, the prime minister [Netanyahu] did an exceptional job here, as did the Qatari PM,” said Witkoff before walking through a scrum of journalists, well-wishers, and security guards.\nPresident Trump envoy @SteveWitkoff tells me: the release of Edan Alexander is a beacon of Hope pic.twitter.com/ftLXbn3dAm\n— Amichai Stein (@AmichaiStein1) May 13, 2025\n“I think there’s a better chance now than before,” to reach a deal with Hamas that sees the remaining 58 hostages in Gaza go free, Boehler said, when asked about the likelihood of a larger deal.\n“I think Hamas knows that they can pull a deal any day that they want. They need to approach Trump, they need to approach [Netanyahu], and they need to set this up the right way,” the envoy added.\nAsked what Israel will decide to do about the war in Gaza after Trump visits the region this week, Boehler replied, “I think that that is up to Israel and they’ll consult with the president. I can’t say.”\n“The one thing I will say is, this is a moment for Israelis. It’s extremely important for Edan Alexander to be put forward, to be released, and I think there is hope of change now,” he said.\nAsked if the US is committed to bringing all hostages back, including non-Americans, Boheler said, “The president has said ‘all the hostages’ and one thing you’ll find with this president is that he sticks with his word.”\nMeanwhile, Alexander’s family notified that he would not fly to Qatar to meet personally with Trump in Saudi Arabia during the president’s trip to the region.\n“The Alexander family confirms that as of now, Edan will not fly to Qatar,” read a statement from the Hostage and Missing Families Forum. “The family remains in continuous contact with the Trump administration.”\nAccording to Hebrew media reports, Alexander is expected to spend at least four days in the hospital, by which time Trump will have departed the region.\nReports on Monday indicated that plans were in the works to have Alexander fly to Qatar at the request of Trump, where he would personally thank the president and the Qatari emir for moves that saw Hamas free him from captivity.\nTrump, whose plane landed Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, is due in Qatar on Wednesday.\nAlexander is expected to meet with Trump later this month at the White House, though a date has not yet been set, Channel 12 reported.\nHis adopted father, Doron Zakser, told the Kan public broadcaster of his great joy at seeing Alexander freed, but also the deep distress he feels over the hostages still in Gaza, while describing the bond that formed between the families of hostages ever since October 7.\n“It is pervasive, it gives no rest,” he said of concern over remaining hostages. “Only when the last one comes back will we say the happiness is complete.”\n“We became one family, there is mutual responsibility,” he said.\nAlexander, the last living hostage with US citizenship, was freed following indirect talks between the US and Hamas. The negotiations sidelined Israeli officials, who were updated only after the deal was struck. The 21-year-old lone soldier had been held in Hamas captivity for 584 days.\nAt the hospital, he is to undergo a series of tests and examinations according to a framework that has been established for all returning hostages, the Walla outlet reported.\nA dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, Alexander was serving in the IDF’s Golani Brigade at the time of his abduction. Hamas kidnapped him from his base near the Gaza border community of Nirim, known as the White House post, during its October 7, 2023, onslaught. Hamas led some 5,600 terrorists to invade southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 others who were taken as hostages to Gaza.\nHamas took 19 male soldiers hostage — not all of them on duty — and seven female surveillance soldiers, the latter of whom have all since been returned to Israel. Five were released in a deal with Hamas, one was rescued, and the body of one was recovered by troops.\nThere are 58 hostages, 35 of whom have been confirmed dead, still held in Gaza.",

    "subheading": "Move designed to register land ownership in Area C of West Bank; Smotrich says act will enable settlement development, and is part of ‘de facto sovereignty revolution’",
    "date": "Updated 12:50 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "The government has approved a cabinet resolution to create a land registration process in Area C of the West Bank, which Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said was designed to “develop settlements” and was part of measures for the “de facto” annexation of the territory.\nUnder the cabinet resolution, a form of executive action, passed on Sunday night, the defense minister will order that “Israeli regional authorities” begin a land registration process and establish an inter-ministerial team prepare to carry out the land registration scheme within 60 days.\nThe resolution also declares that a land registry process being conducted by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank will have no legal validity in Israel, and orders security agencies to thwart the conduct of that registration process.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz who, along with Smotrich, advanced the resolution, lauded the measure, saying that it “does justice for Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria, and will strengthen, consolidate and broaden it.”\nSettler groups and right-wing organizations praised the passage of the resolution as an assertion of Israeli sovereignty and land rights over the West Bank.\nThe Peace Now organization, which campaigns against the settlements, described the land registration initiative as a “mega theft of Palestinian land,” which it said would not enable Palestinians to fairly register their private land and constituted the next step to de facto annexation of the West Bank.\nThe ownership of some two-thirds of all West Bank land has never been formally registered. In Area C, which constitutes some 60% of the entire territory, the figure is similar, with two-thirds registered and one-third not registered, according to Peace Now.\nThe Jordanians began a land registration process when they controlled the West Bank between 1949 and 1967, but that process was halted in 1968 by Israel, after its capture of the territory in the Six Day War the year before.\nSmotrich said that the cabinet resolution was “part of the normalization and de facto sovereignty revolution that we are leading in Judea and Samaria,” and that for the first time “the State of Israel is taking responsibility for the territory as a permanent sovereign.”\nThis, he said, “will create legal certainty, enable land reserves for settlement development,” and prevent what he said were the Palestinian Authority’s efforts “to take over open areas.”\nThe finance minister added that the land registry was part of a broader governmental project to bring in another one million people to live in the West Bank settlements to “strengthen the security belt of the State of Israel, and eliminate the danger of the Palestinian terrorist state.”\nYoni Mizrahi of the Peace Now organization expressed concern that, in light of Smotrich’s comments that the goal of the land registration process was to advance settlement development, it would be extremely hard for Palestinians in Area C to effectively register their private property.\nHe also asserted that under international law, Israel does not have the right to conduct such a land registry given that it holds the West Bank under what is known as a belligerent occupation, in which actions permanently altering the status of the territory are prohibited.\n“If you can conduct a land registration process and control how it is carried out, then this is annexation,” said Mizrahi.\nPeace Now asserted that Israel as the “occupying power” could not be a neutral party to fairly adjudicate land claims, and that Palestinian landowners would not have access to the documents and information in Israel’s possession to prove their ownership rights.\nAs a result, Palestinian landowners face a severe risk of losing title to their land in the registration process, the organization said.\nThe right-wing Regavim organization, which campaigns against illegal Palestinian construction in the West Bank, said that the new land registration process was “a pivotal advancement” in thwarting the Palestinian Authority’s land registration effort.\n“For years, Israel stood idle while the Palestinian Authority aggressively pursued land registration, deploying hundreds of workers and funneling millions of dollars from international sources,” said the organization.   “We extend our gratitude to Defense Minister Israel Katz, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and our esteemed partners, for their resolute leadership in advancing this critical initiative to safeguard our territorial integrity, our land, and secure our collective future.”\nAnd the Yesha Council, an umbrella organization representing settlement municipal authorities around the West Bank, called the measure “fantastic news” for settlements in the West Bank.\n“The land registration in Judea and Samaria is another expression of the change in perception that is so necessary in the area, [that] the State of Israel is the sovereign,” said the organization.",

    "subheading": "The journalist became a hero in Israel and a target at home for her unwavering support after October 7, but her new role on Elon Musk’s X brings its own set of contradictions",
    "date": "Updated 12:09 PM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "A few hours after touching down in Tel Aviv, Erin Molan stood at the edge of the Mediterranean, scanning the sky. A Houthi missile had recently landed nearby, bringing most air traffic to a standstill.\n“I was looking outside at where it had landed and thinking about the absence of any condemnation for the injured innocent civilians or potential fatalities that could have occurred,” she said. “Every second, every day, I’m reminded of how hypocritical the rest of the world is.”\nOn her third visit to Israel in the past year, Molan was a guest of right-wing organization Nikraim LaDegel (Called to the Flag) at whose “Salute to Israel’s Independence Day” event she spoke on May 5. She also attended the Atlas Awards held by the Ayn Rand Center to receive an award for Moral Courage in recognition of her support for Israel and her commitment to truth in journalism.\nHer schedule was short — just two nights in Tel Aviv — but densely packed with meetings, speeches, and encounters with families whose lives had been upended by war.\nShe recalled meeting a father whose child is still held hostage in Gaza, and a woman whose son was mistakenly shot by an IDF soldier.\n“She held no anger,” Molan said. “That kind of forgiveness, that kind of resilience, stays with you.”\nThe Australian broadcaster, best known until recently for her sharp commentary on sports and politics, has spent the past seven months as one of the world’s most public pro-Israel advocates, highlighting the plight of the hostages and defending Israel’s war in Gaza.\nMolan has found herself increasingly recognized in Israel, where people on the street often flock to her, eager to thank her for her support.\nShe says that while the trip renewed her sense of purpose, she feels conflicted over the public praise.\n“I just tell the truth, and I feel guilty that people feel the need to thank me. It shouldn’t be courageous to say that murdering civilians is evil,” she told The Times of Israel.\nEighteen months ago, Molan was a popular and well-known journalist at Sky News Australia, a subscription-based channel known for its influence in conservative political circles.\nMolan joined the network in 2022 as a primetime contributor and host of a weekly current affairs program, “Erin,” which featured interviews, political commentary, and Molan’s perspectives on domestic and international issues.\nMolan, who is Catholic and had never been to Israel, found her life and career turned upside down following Hamas’s October 7, 2023, massacre, in which terrorists killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in Israel and kidnapped 251 into Gaza.\nStunned by the invasion, she immediately began expressing solidarity, initially on social media and then in broadcast segments.\n“It was never complex to me or grey or fuzzy. It was black and white as to who evil was in this scenario,” she said.\nBut for Molan, it was the responses to the attack that shocked and activated her more than the attack itself.\n“October 7 wasn’t the most horrifying part — it was the world’s reaction to it,” she said.\nA few days after the massacre, before Israel had even mounted a response, Molan watched as crowds gathered in Sydney in celebration of the attack. One rally lit up the Sydney Opera House in which attendees were screaming, among other things, “Gas the Jews.”\n“That was probably the first time I felt genuine shame for my country,” she said. “It was horrific, sickening, gut-wrenching.”\nMolan says that she was “completely naive” about the antisemitism that existed in the West, especially in her native Australia, where some 2,062 antisemitic incidents were recorded between October 2023 and September 2024, compared to 495 incidents a year earlier, according to data from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ).\n“I had absolutely no idea what lay just under the surface.”\nIn a monologue broadcast on Sky News, Molan said, “This is a war not just against Jews but against the West,” she told viewers. “This is a moment where we choose what side we’re on, and if we get it wrong, the consequences will be catastrophic.”\nIn Israel, Molan became something of a sensation — hailed as a rare voice of clarity and compassion in a global media landscape many Israelis saw as indifferent, if not outright hostile.\nBack home in Australia, however, the fallout was swift and more intense than Molan expected.\n“When after a terrorist attack I came out very strongly in support of the victims and staunchly opposed to the terrorists who committed those atrocities, never did I think for a second that I would be considered controversial or in the minority,” she says.\nAs a public figure — one of the first women to anchor a major sports show in Australia — Molan had weathered criticism before, but says this was of a different order.\n“I was the first woman in Australia to host one of the most popular sporting shows, so the abuse and horrific things that were written about me basically because I’m a woman were pretty intense,” she said.\n“Any time a woman is uncompromising in her beliefs or takes a stance that is considered bold, a lot of the world’s reaction is to be uncomfortable with that.”\nAs Molan’s star rose and she became known to audiences the world over for her commentary on Israel, the criticism intensified. She received a torrent of death threats, including some targeted against her 6-year-old daughter.\nThen, quietly and without much explanation, her role at Sky News Australia was cut. In December, she confirmed she was no longer with the broadcaster. Though no explicit reason was given, many are convinced her pro-Israel stance was the deciding factor.\nMolan says that she cares as much about “children suffering in Gaza as children in Israel. I just understand who their real enemy is, which is Hamas.”\n“Peace is the ultimate goal for Israel and for all of us who believe in freedom and democracy, but there is no peace for anyone in this region — including the people of Gaza– whilst Hamas exists.”\nWhile some may have expected her to retreat into obscurity or moderate her tone to appeal to a broader audience, Molan has only become more vocal in her support for Israel.\nShe also found a new platform in the digital space, one less encumbered by editorial constraints. In February 2025, Molan launched a new weekly news program called “69 X Minutes” on Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter), drawing 10 million views on its premiere night.\nShe describes it as “unfiltered, unbiased and raw” — a vehicle for the kind of truth-telling Molan felt mainstream media could no longer accommodate.\nYet her presence on X places her in a complex — and, to some, contradictory — position. Under Musk’s ownership, the platform has amplified extremist voices, reinstated previously banned antisemitic content and allowed white supremacists to flourish. Musk himself has echoed antisemitic conspiracy theories and engaged with known hate accounts.\nFor Molan, a high-profile ally of Israel and outspoken opponent of antisemitism, this alignment raises an obvious paradox: claiming to fight antisemitism on a platform that has done more than almost any other to spread it.\nMolan doesn’t see it that way. She insists that fighting hatred requires going directly to the spaces where it thrives.\n“Existing in an echo chamber is a waste of time,” she says. “You need to be where those antisemitic voices are to fight back.”\nShe argues that platforms like X offer unparalleled reach, and that she’s committed to using the largest megaphone available to “drown those voices out.”\nCertainly, her presence on X has extended her influence far beyond what legacy media once afforded her. Beyond her news channel, Molan has become a highly sought-after speaker in Israel, the United States, and elsewhere, invited to address issues ranging from security to free speech.\nHer interest in national security and public service, she says, stems from her late father, Jim Molan, a highly respected Australian Army major general and senator who led the country’s forces in Iraq during the war.\nThere have even been quiet efforts to encourage her to run for office in Australia — something she has ruled out for now, citing her focus on caring for her daughter.\nWhatever she does next, and despite the death threats, professional setbacks, and having no obvious skin in the game, Molan is adamant that her advocacy for Israel will remain a part of her life.\n“It isn’t just Israel that is under attack — it’s every single thing that I hold dear; it’s my daughter’s future,” she says.\n“I don’t have one iota of doubt that I’m standing on the right side of history.”",

    "date": "Updated 11:27 AM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "BERLIN (AP) — The German government banned this week the largest “Reich citizen” group, an extremist far-right organization that calls itself the “Kingdom of Germany” and seeks to undermine the country’s democratic order.\nFour of its leaders were arrested.\nSince early Tuesday morning, hundreds of security forces in several states have been searching the association’s properties and the homes of leading members.\n“The members of this association have created a ‘counter-state’ in our country and built up economic criminal structures,” Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said, adding that the members of the group underpinned their supposed claim to power with antisemitic conspiracy narratives — a behavior that the country cannot tolerate.\n“We will take decisive action against those who attack our free democratic basic order,” Dobrindt added.\nThe so-called “ Reich citizen, ” or “Reichsbürger,” movement does not recognize Germany as a state. Many of them claim that the historical German Reich still exists and ignore the country’s democratic and constitutional structures such as parliament, laws or courts. They also refuse to pay taxes, social security contributions or fines.\nThe so-called “Kingdom of Germany” was proclaimed by its leader Peter Fitzek — who was among those arrested on Tuesday — in the eastern town of Wittenberg in 2012 and says it has around 6,000 followers, the interior ministry said in a statement. It claims to be a “counter-state” that seceded from the German federal government.\nThe group’s online platforms will be blocked and its assets will be confiscated to ensure that no further financial resources can be used for extremist purposes.\nIt’s not the first time that Germany has acted against the “Reichsbürger” movement.\nIn 2023, German police officers searched the homes of about 20 people in connection with investigations into the far-right Reich Citizens scene, whose adherents had similarities to followers of the QAnon movement in the United States.\nLast year, the alleged leaders of a suspected far-right plot to topple Germany’s government went on trial in a case that shocked the country.",

    "date": "Updated 07:52 PM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "The Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court ordered on Monday that Yonatan Urich, a close aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is a key suspect in the so-called Qatargate scandal, be released to house arrest for ten days.\nThe police had sought to keep Urich under house arrest for three weeks, but Judge Menachem Mizrahi cut that period in half.\nThe court also issued a travel ban against Urich until August 12, and banned him from contacting anyone involved in the case.\nUrich, together with Eli Feldstein, a former military affairs spokesperson for Netanyahu, is suspected of multiple offenses tied to their alleged work for a pro-Qatar lobbying firm. They are suspected of contact with a foreign agent and breach of trust, due to what prosecutors believe was their work to improve Doha’s image as a hostage negotiation mediator, while simultaneously working as advisers to Netanyahu.\nThe investigation has broadened and several former senior security officials are suspected of involvement in helping transfer money from Doha to Urich and Feldstein.\nMizrahi made unusual remarks during Monday’s custody hearing, indicating he does not believe Urich will ultimately be indicted.\nAfter Urich’s attorney Amit Hadad remarked that “the day will come when we see all the [investigative] material,” referring to when Urich is indicted, Mizrahi replied “Such a day will not come, it won’t happen,” indicating he believes that Netanyahu’s aide will not face charges.\nThe decision to file charges is ultimately in the hands of the State Attorney’s Office, but Mizrahi’s comments appear to reflect a belief that there is either insufficient evidence for charging Urich with the crimes he is suspected of, or that he has not actually committed a crime.\nLast Wednesday, Mizrahi raised substantive questions over the investigation, pointing out that although Urich was doing work for the prime minister, he was not employed as a formal employee of the Prime Minister’s Office and was therefore not a civil servant.\nOnly civil servants can be charged with crimes such as bribery and breach of trust, which the police wish to level against Urich.\nMizrachi’s comments were unexpected, as he previously argued with Urich’s attorney against claims that Urich is not a civil servant, noting previous court rulings establishing that it is the role filled by a suspect and not the formal position that person holds that determines civil servant status.\nUrich was rearrested last week after police sought to question him regarding what they said was new evidence that had emerged surrounding his role in the scandal, but the Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court ordered him to be released, saying there was no reason for his ongoing detention.\nThe Lod Central District Court upheld an appeal by the police to keep him in custody, saying the new evidence heightened suspicions against Urich, and the Supreme Court upheld that decision after Urich appealed.\nIn a subtle rebuke, however, the Supreme Court told police that if they wished to make further requests for Urich to remain in custody, they should focus on claims that he might pervert the course of justice if released, rather than asserting the supposed danger he poses to state security.",

    "article": "PARIS — Iran’s foreign minister warned Britain, France and Germany Monday that a decision to trigger a UN mechanism reimposing sanctions on Tehran could lead to an irreversible escalation of tensions.\nUnder the terms of a UN resolution ratifying a 2015 nuclear pact, the three European powers could reimpose United Nations sanctions against Tehran before October 18, known in diplomatic circles as the “snapback mechanism.”\nThey were said to be mulling the option as a form of diplomatic leverage, as the US seeks to ramp up pressure on Iran amid ongoing nuclear talks between the two countries.\n“Iran has made its position clear. We have officially warned all JCPOA [nuclear pact] signatories that abuse of the snapback mechanism will lead to consequences — not only the end of Europe’s role in the agreement, but also an escalation of tensions that could become irreversible,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote in a column in French weekly magazine Le Point.\nUS President Donald Trump exited Tehran’s 2015 nuclear accord with six world powers in 2018 during his first term and reimposed tough sanctions that devastated Iran’s economy.\nThe European powers are not part of current negotiations between Iran and the US, the fourth round of which ended in Oman Sunday. But the three powers have sought to coordinate closely with Washington with a view to whether and when they should use the snapback mechanism to raise pressure on Iran.\nTalks between the so-called E3 and Iran in Rome earlier in May were postponed. Araghchi said that a meeting between Iran’s deputy foreign minister and E3 counterparts had since taken place, describing them as a “promising, but fragile start.”\nFrance’s foreign ministry declined to comment. The British and German foreign ministries were not immediately available to comment.\nAccording to diplomats and a document seen by Reuters, the E3 countries may trigger a snapback by August if no substantial deal can be found by then. The window closes on October 18.\nRelations between the E3 and Iran have worsened over the last year despite sporadic meetings, against a backdrop of new sanctions imposed on Tehran over its ballistic missile program, its detention of foreign citizens and support for Russia in its war against Ukraine.\nIran, which has long denied having nuclear weapons and insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, has breached the 2015 pact’s nuclear curbs since 2019, including “dramatically” accelerating its enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% level that is weapons-grade, according to the UN nuclear watchdog.",

    "date": "Updated 05:53 PM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "Israel asked the International Criminal Court last week to withdraw arrest warrants that it issued for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant, as the ICC reviews Israeli challenges to its jurisdiction over the Gaza war.\nDocuments published on the ICC website late on Sunday, dated May 9, show Israel also asked the court to suspend the investigation of their alleged crimes until the judges rule on a jurisdictional challenge presented by Israel.\nThe documents are signed by Israeli Deputy Attorney General Gilad Noam.\nThey were published as ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan faces allegations of sexually assaulting a member of his staff, and amid speculation that these allegations spurred Khan to issue the warrants.\nThe ICC issued arrest warrants on November 21 for Netanyahu and Gallant over alleged war crimes amid the war in Gaza, including “starvation as a method of war.”\nIsrael rejects the jurisdiction of The Hague-based court. It also insists that its fighting in Gaza has accorded with international law, citing measures it has taken to avoid civilian casualties and to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid. It is contesting the warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant.\nThe court also issued warrants for Hamas terror chiefs Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh for crimes against humanity during the October 7, 2023, onslaught — in which some 5,000 Hamas-led terrorists killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, starting the war — and beyond, but withdrew the warrants after all three were killed by Israel in separate incidents.\nIn April, the ICC’s appeals chamber ruled that the judges of the pre-trial chamber, which issued the warrants, must review Israel’s objections regarding the court’s jurisdiction and the legality of the arrest warrants.\nIt is unclear what form the ordered review will take, and there are no specific deadlines set for decisions on Israel’s request that warrants be withdrawn and the investigation halted.\nThe Israeli request was submitted a day before The Wall Street Journal, on Saturday, published a report detailing allegations that Khan forced sexual intercourse upon a member of staff on multiple occasions.\n“The timing of the announcement [of the warrants] has spurred questions about whether Khan was aiming to protect himself from the sexual-assault allegations,” the report noted.\nA day before announcing he applied for the warrants, Khan abruptly canceled a trip to Israel and Gaza, which he had previously said would be important for making a decision on the matter.\nKhan denies all wrongdoing, and has alleged that the accusations against him are part of an effort to undermine the ICC. The Journal report also said that court officials were concerned that the Mossad was operating at The Hague. No further details were given.\nKhan remains in his position, and the ICC did not respond to a Journal request for comment.",

    "date": "Updated 01:18 PM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced his new Cabinet on Monday after former minister Ed Husic blamed his demotion on his own criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza.\nAlbanese named the 30 lawmakers who will fill Cabinet and outer-ministry positions after his center-left Labor Party won a landslide victory in the May 3 elections.\nLabor has claimed 92 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, the lower chamber where parties need a majority to form government. As vote counting continues, Albanese said his government could hold as many as 95 seats.\nLabor had never held more seats since the first Parliament sat in 1901, he said.\n“I’m deeply humbled by the trust that was put into my government with the election, and we certainly won’t take it for granted,” Albanese told reporters at Parliament House.\nWhile Labor prime ministers allocate the ministerial portfolios, the party’s factional leaders pick the 30 lawmakers who will get them based on the proportion of seats each faction won.\nThe factional leaders dropped former industry and science minister Husic, who was born in Sydney to Bosnian Muslim immigrants, and former attorney-general Mark Dreyfus, who is Jewish.\nHusic, who, after the 2022 election, became Australia’s first federal minister to be sworn into office on a Quran, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. on Sunday that Albanese should have intervened to keep him and Dreyfus in Cabinet.\nHusic said his demotion was in part punishment for his views on how Israel has waged war against the Hamas terror group in Gaza.\n“I think it’s been a factor in there. Would I do things differently? I don’t think so,” Husic told ABC.\n“You can’t celebrate diversity and then expect it to sit in a corner and be silent. You need to speak up… for the communities that you care about,” Husic added.\nAlbanese did not directly answer when asked whether he had fought for either Husic or Dreyfus to remain in Cabinet.\n“We have a process in the Labor Party caucus. You’ve been watching it for some time,” Albanese told reporters.\nAlbanese said he had a “constructive discussion” with Husic on Monday morning.\n“What I’ve done is to allocate portfolios. That’s the system that’s there. It’s one that Ed and others have supported for a long period of time,” Albanese said.\nBilal Rauf, an adviser to the Australian National Imams Council, called for Albanese to explain whether Husic’s demotion was due to his views on Gaza.\n“I think at a minimum, some explanation is warranted. We can’t just leave it at explanations about factionalism,” Rauf said.\n“If Ed says that’s a factor, I have no reason to discount that,” Rauf said. “It’s hard to deny that it likely is a factor.”\nAlex Ryvchin, co-chief executive officer of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said his advocacy group had enjoyed good relations with both Dreyfus and Husic.\nHowever, Husic had made statements after Hamas’s massacre on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that were “very troublesome for the community.”\n“He levelled accusations at Israel which we fundamentally disagree with but again reasonable people will differ on these things and we wish Ed Husic all the best,” Ryvchin said.\nHusic said two weeks after the Hamas onslaught: “I feel very strongly that Palestinians are being collectively punished… for Hamas’ barbarism.”\nHusic said on Sunday the Israeli government had “atrociously managed this.”\nEgypt-born Anne Aly has been promoted to Cabinet, making her the government’s most senior Muslim. She is the minister for small business, international development and multicultural affairs.\nAlbanese’s second-term administration is the first Australian government since 2010 to have no Jewish Cabinet minister.\nMost of the government’s most senior ministers have portfolios that are unchanged or slightly varied.\nDeputy Prime Minister Richard Marles remained the defense minister. Home Affairs Tony Burke’s portfolio has been expanded to include the Australian Federal Police and the nation’s main domestic spy agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization.\nTim Ayres, the former assistant trade minister, was promoted to Cabinet to take Husic’s portfolio.\nDreyfus was replaced by Michelle Rowland, who had been the communications minister in the government’s first term.\nAustralia, over the past year, has largely departed from its policy of voting against or abstaining from pro-Palestinian resolutions in the UN.\nIn December, it voted in favor of a UN General Assembly resolution calling on Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza, and last May, it voted for a resolution recognizing the Palestinians as qualified to become a full UN member and recommending that the UN Security Council consider the matter.\nTimes of Israel staff contributed to this report.",

    "article": "NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian and Pakistani authorities said Monday there was no firing reported overnight along the heavily militarized region between their countries, the first time in recent days the two nations were not shooting at each other.\nIndia and Pakistan reached an understanding to stop all military actions on land, in the air and at the sea Saturday in a US-brokered ceasefire to stop the escalating hostilities between the two nuclear-armed rivals that threatened regional peace.\n“The night remained largely peaceful across Jammu and Kashmir, and other areas along the international border,” the Indian army said in a statement, adding that no incidents had been reported.\nSenior military officials from India and Pakistan are scheduled to speak later Monday to assess if the ceasefire was holding. There were fears it would not hold after they accused each other of violations just hours after it was announced.\nLocal government officials in Pakistan-administered Kashmir reported no incidents of cross-border firing along the Line of Control and said that civilians displaced by recent skirmishes between Pakistani and Indian forces were returning to their homes.\nPakistan’s military spokesperson, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif, said late Sunday that Pakistan remains committed to upholding the ceasefire and will not be the first to violate it.\nHe also confirmed that senior military officials from both nations would speak by phone on Monday.\nSoon after the ceasefire announcement on Saturday, Pakistan reopened all of its airports and restored flight operations. India followed up Monday with reopening of all the 32 airports that were shut temporarily across northern and western regions amid the flare-up in tensions.\n“It’s informed that these airports are now available for civil aircraft operations with immediate effect,” the Airports Authority of India said in a statement.\nThe militaries of the two countries have been engaged in one of their most serious confrontations in decades since last Wednesday, when India struck targets inside Pakistan it said were affiliated with militants responsible for the massacre of 26 tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir. The tourists, mostly Indian Hindu men, were brutally killed in front of their families in the meadow town of Pahalgam last month.\nIndia accused Pakistan of backing the militants who carried out the massacre, a charge Islamabad denied. The incident first led to a spat of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures by both the nations, sending their bilateral ties to a near historic low.\nThe two expelled each other’s diplomats, shut their airspace, land borders, and suspended a crucial water treaty.\nAfter Wednesday’s strikes in Pakistan, both sides exchanged heavy fires along their de facto border in the restive Kashmir region followed by missile and drone strikes into each other’s territories, mainly targeting military installations and airbases. Dozens of civilians were killed on both sides in heavy shelling, the two countries said.\nThe Indian military on Sunday for the first time claimed its strikes into Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and Pakistan last week killed more than 100 militants, including prominent leaders.\nLt. Gen. Rajiv Ghai, the director general of India’s military operations, who will be talking to his Pakistani counterpart on Monday, said India’s armed forces struck nine militant infrastructure and training facilities, including sites of the Lashkar-e-Taiba group that India blames for carrying out major militant strikes in India and the disputed region of Kashmir.\nGhai said at least 35 to 40 Pakistani soldiers were killed in clashes along the Line of Control, the de facto border that divides the disputed Kashmir region between India and Pakistan. Five Indian soldiers were also killed, he said.\nPakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday said his country’s armed forces had killed 40 to 50 Indian soldiers along the Line of Control. The Pakistani military also claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and inflicted heavy losses on Indian military installations by targeting 26 locations in India.\nThe Associated Press couldn’t independently verify the claims made by India and Pakistan.",

    "article": "DAMASCUS, Syria — The remains of 30 people believed to have been killed by the Islamic State terror group have been found in a remote Syrian town in a search led by Qatari search teams and the FBI, according to a statement from Qatar on Monday.\nThe Qatari internal security forces said the FBI had requested the search, and that DNA tests are currently underway to determine the identities of the people. The Qatari agency did not say who the American intelligence and security agency is trying to find.\nDozens of foreigners, including aid workers and journalists, were killed by IS terrorists who had controlled large swaths of Syria and Iraq for half a decade and declared a so-called caliphate. The group lost most of its territory in late 2017 and was declared defeated in 2019.\nSince then, dozens of gravesites and mass graves have been discovered in northern Syria containing remains and bodies of people IS had abducted over the years.\nAmerican-Israeli journalist Steven Sotloff, fellow US journalist James Foley, and humanitarian workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig are among those killed by IS.\nJohn Cantlie, a British correspondent, was abducted alongside Foley in 2012, and was last seen alive in one of the extremist group’s propaganda videos in 2016.\nThe search took place in the town of Dabiq, near Syria’s northern border with Turkey.\nMass graves have also been found in areas previously controlled by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who was ousted in a lightning insurgency in December, ending his family’s half-century rule. For years, the Assads used their notorious security and intelligence agencies to crack down on dissidents, many of whom have gone missing.\nThe United Nations in 2021 estimated that over 130,000 Syrians were taken away and disappeared during the uprising that began in 2011 and descended into a 13-year civil war.\nLast June, a federal United States appeals court upheld the conviction of a British national for his role in a hostage-taking scheme by the Islamic State group that was tied to the abductions of Foley, Sotloff, Mueller, and Kassig.",

    "date": "Updated 12:40 PM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "Germany’s Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Sunday that the conflict in Gaza cannot be solved by military means and a political solution must be found to end the war permanently, while visiting Israel to mark 60 years of bilateral relations.\n“I do not believe that this conflict can be permanently resolved by military means,” Wadephul said in Jerusalem. “Nevertheless, it is urgently necessary that Hamas is disarmed and that it can no longer have military control over Gaza.”\nHe said Germany would do whatever it took to guarantee Israel’s security, but this did not mean that his country could not criticize Israel’s actions. He added, though, that this “must not lead to antisemitism.”\n“I am not sure whether all of Israel’s strategic goals can be achieved in this way [through a military campaign] and whether this will serve Israel’s security in the long term,” Wadephul said. “That is why we are appealing for a return to serious negotiations on a ceasefire.”\nWadephul declared that the return of hostages held by terrorists in Gaza is the German government’s priority.\nHe also said it was clear that Gaza was Palestinian territory. “We need a political solution for the reconstruction of Gaza without Hamas,” Wadephul said.\nThe war against Hamas in Gaza, sparked by the terror group’s October 7, 2023, massacre in Israel, has cast a shadow over relations, with Germany at pains to carefully calibrate its response.\nNew German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said last Tuesday, the day he took power, “Israel has the right to defend itself against the brutal attack by Hamas terrorists on October 7 and everything that followed.”\n“But Israel must also remain a country that lives up to its humanitarian obligations, especially as this terrible war is raging in the Gaza Strip, where this confrontation with Hamas terrorists is necessarily taking place,” he said.\nDuring his visit on Sunday, Wadephul met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as his counterpart, Gideon Sa’ar. Berlin’s top diplomat toured Israel’s Arrow missile defense system at the Defense Ministry’s Directorate of Defense, Research and Development, and Yad Vashem Holocaust museum with Sa’ar, who said he had been invited to visit his counterpart in Berlin and “will have the honor of visiting Germany very soon, hopefully in the beginning of June.”\n“We’ve had excellent relations, we’ll continue them in this conversation,” Netanyahu said, alongside Wadephul ahead of their meeting at the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem, in a video shared by the PMO.\n“We have a lot of common interests, a lot of common values, and a lot of common challenges…I will send my best regards to Friedrich Merz and to your joint efforts to continue the Israel–Germany alliance,” he continued.\nWadephul replied, “It’s a privilege to be here on the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries.”\nAlongside Wadephul’s visit, President Isaac Herzog is visiting Germany to mark the milestone in ties.\nIn 1952, Israel and West Germany signed a reparations agreement to help Jerusalem fund the cost of resettling Jewish Holocaust refugees as well as compensating them for the loss of property under the Nazi regime. However, it wasn’t until 1965 that full diplomatic relations were formed. East Germany never maintained full relations with Jerusalem.\nIn his first phone call to the premier since assuming office Thursday, Merz discussed Gaza and regional issues with Netanyahu, and also “reiterated that the existence and security of Israel are a part of German raison d’être,” according to a Berlin readout.\nStanding alongside Wadephul at a press conference in Jerusalem, Sa’ar said Iran’s uranium enrichment facilities “must be dismantled” and that the US and Israel agree on this issue. Next to Sa’ar, Wadephul said, “Iran is an issue that greatly concerns” Germany.\n“The most dangerous regime must not be allowed to obtain the world’s most dangerous weapon. Its uranium enrichment facilities must be dismantled,” said Sa’ar at the Foreign Ministry.",

    "subheading": "Families decry government for being left out of loop of talks; Netanyahu’s office: Israel has committed to safe corridor for Alexander’s release, but not to truce",
    "date": "Updated 11:41 AM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "Families of the hostages were torn early Monday between joy at the announced coming release of US-Israeli Edan Alexander from captivity in the Gaza Strip and anxiety over the continued plight of their own loved ones still held by terror groups in the Palestinian territory. The Israeli government was also widely panned for being sidelined in the talks to secure Alexander’s release.\nThe US and Hamas both confirmed late Sunday that the terror group would release Alexander in what was described as a goodwill gesture to US President Donald Trump ahead of his visit to the region this week.\nIsrael, which sources said was not involved in talks for the release, claimed Monday the development was the result of its military pressure on Hamas, while opposition lawmakers and families of hostages panned the government for not having been a party to talks, for not pursuing a broad deal to bring all of the remaining hostages home, and for allowing negotiations to take place that apparently favored hostages with dual citizenship.\nAlexander, a dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, was serving in the Israel Defense Forces at the time of his abduction. He was kidnapped from his base during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led onslaught that started the war in Gaza. It was not immediately clear when he would be released, but some reports suggested it could be as early as Monday.\nAlexander’s parents flew to Israel with US hostage envoy Adam Boehler on Sunday night in order to arrive in time for their son’s release.\nA statement on behalf of the Alexanders said that they are in constant contact with the US government and that “no hostage should be left behind.”\nThe family of hostage Alon Ohel on Monday criticized the planned release of Alexander while leaving the rest of the hostages behind, noting that their son is continuing to suffer in captivity.\n“The deal leaves Alon behind while he is injured and in pain,” the family said in a statement carried by Hebrew media. “We are in a nightmare and frightened.”\nThe comments reflected a sense of unease among some hostages’ families that the arrangement securing Alexander’s release, which the US says is part of an effort to end the war and free all hostages, differentiates between those in Gaza based on what passports they hold. Ohel’s mother Idit has been particularly vocal against what she terms a form of selection between hostages during previous rounds of releases.\nAccording to the family, relying on information from freed hostages, Ohel has been kept bound in chains and received no medical attention for shrapnel in his eye and shoulder from wounds suffered on October 7, 2023.\n“With a broken heart,” the family’s statement offered good wishes to the Alexander family on their son’s impending freedom and urged Israel’s government to reach a deal securing the release of the rest of the hostages.\n“Alon and the rest of the injured hostages are being left behind in the tunnels with no medical attention or help,” the family said. “There is no date for the end of our nightmare.”\nEinav Zangauker, mother of hostage Matan Zangauker, said in a statement that her son was held with Alexander.\n“The two of them are in a dark tunnel without any other hostages. If Matan is left alone in the tunnel, Netanyahu is deciding to murder my boy; instead of releasing all of the hostages, he has become my private angel of death.”\nZangauker, whose combative criticism of the government has made her a prominent activist on behalf of the hostages, vowed to “hunt down the prime minister” for the suffering caused to her son.\nThe family of Itay Chen, a dual US-Israeli citizen whose body is held in Gaza, said in a statement, “These are moments of mixed feelings. We rejoice in the joy of Yael and Adi Alexander, who will soon get to hug their son. Every hostage that comes home warms the hearts of the families of hostages. On the other hand, our hearts cannot bear the deep grief. It is possible, and necessary, to bring everyone back.”\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the main group representing hostage families, said in a statement Sunday that the release of Alexander “must be the start of a single agreement that will return all 59 [remaining] hostages.”\n“There is only one moral, proper, and necessary agreement: the immediate return of all the hostages and the end of the war,” said the forum, which has long been calling for the government to agree to a deal that will return all the remaining hostages at once, rather than in phases.\n“Now is the time to bring about a breakthrough in negotiations. The responsibility lies with the Israeli government,” it added. “Nobody can be left behind.”\nOn Monday, the forum announced a rally to be held at noon in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv in anticipation of Alexander’s release.\nIn a post to X, Opposition Leader Yair Lapid said that Alexander’s release “must lead to a broad hostage deal that will return home all the hostages. They have no time.”\nHe further said that reports of direct contact between the US and Hamas to reach the agreement “are a disgraceful failure of diplomacy by the Israeli government and the person who heads it. The hostages are ours, and the responsibility to return them is of the government.”\nOpposition MK Benny Gantz, leader of the National Unity Party, posted that “the heart swells at the apparent return of Edan — the stomach turns to see how the Israeli government is absent from every initiative to take responsibility.”\n“The time has come for the prime minister to exercise that responsibility,” he wrote.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel has committed to facilitating a safe corridor for the return of Alexander.\nIn a statement, the Prime Minister’s Office said Jerusalem has, however, made no further promise for a ceasefire or for the release of Palestinian security prisoners, who have been exchanged for hostages in previous deals.\n“The expected release of IDF soldier Edan Alexander [by Hamas] without getting anything in return, will be possible thanks to the determined policy we led, with the backing of [US] President [Donald] Trump, and thanks to IDF troops’ military pressure in the Gaza Strip,” the PMO said.\n“We are in critical days in which Hamas is facing a deal that would enable our hostages’ release,” it added. “Negotiations will continue under fire and amidst preparations for the intensification of the fighting.”\nEarlier, the PMO confirmed that the US informed Israel that Hamas will release hostage Alexander “without any compensation or conditions” as a gesture of goodwill to the US.\nAn Israeli official claimed in an anonymous statement to reporters that Alexander’s imminent release was secured thanks to Israel’s military pressure on Hamas.\n“Hamas understood it must make a gesture to the Americans because this is the only way for it to try to prevent the expansion of the war,” the official said.\nAppearing to respond to criticism from hostage families and the opposition that Alexander was being freed solely due to his American nationality, the official added: “Thanks to the military pressure, Hamas agreed thus far to release most of our hostages, regardless of foreign passports. We will continue to do everything to return all of our hostages.”\nThe official said Israel will facilitate a safe corridor to get Alexander out of Gaza — presumably meaning halting fighting and reconnaissance flights in certain areas — but stressed that there is no ceasefire and that Hamas isn’t getting anything in return for the release. If Hamas agrees to an Israel-accepted proposal for a wider hostage deal, the expansion of the war will be postponed, the official added.\nTerror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 59 hostages, including 58 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF. The Hamas attack also killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians.\nHamas released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire between January and March. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. In exchange, Israel has freed some 2,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners, and Gazan terror suspects detained during the war.\nEight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.\nThe body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas, and is counted among the 59 hostages.",

    "subheading": "With Gulf help, Sharaa launches bid to get face time with Trump during his Mideast visit, with a pitch that includes a detente with Israel and US access to Syria’s oil and gas",
    "date": "Updated 10:16 AM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "DAMASCUS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) — A Trump Tower in Damascus, a detente with Israel and US access to Syria’s oil and gas are part of Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa’s strategic pitch to try to get face time with US President Donald Trump during his trip to the Middle East, according to several sources familiar with the push to woo Washington.\nJonathan Bass, an American pro-Trump activist who on April 30 met Sharaa for four hours in Damascus, along with Syrian activists and Gulf Arab states has been trying to arrange a landmark — if highly unlikely — meeting between the two leaders this week on the sidelines of Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\nSyria has struggled to implement conditions set out by Washington for relief from US sanctions, which keep the country cut off from the global financial system and make economic recovery extremely challenging after 14 years of grinding war.\nBass hopes that getting Trump into a room with Sharaa, who still remains a US-designated terrorist over his al-Qaeda past, could help soften the Republican president and his administration’s thinking on Damascus and cool an increasingly tense relationship between Syria and Israel.\nPart of the bet for the effort is based on Trump’s history of breaking with longstanding US foreign policy taboos, such as when he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea in 2019.\n“Sharaa wants a business deal for the future of his country,” Bass said, noting it could cover energy exploitation, cooperation against Iran and engagement with Israel.\n“He told me he wants a Trump Tower in Damascus. He wants peace with his neighbors. What he told me is good for the region, good for Israel,” said Bass.\nSharaa also shared what he saw as a personal connection with Trump: both have been shot at, narrowly surviving attempts on their lives, Bass said.\nSyrian officials and a presidency media official did not respond to a request for comment.\nSharaa spoke with Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Sunday, according to the Syrian presidency.\nA person close to Sharaa said afterwards a Trump-Sharaa meeting remained possible in Saudi Arabia, but would not confirm whether Sharaa had received an invitation.\n“Whether or not the meeting takes place won’t be known until the last moment,” the person said.\nTo be clear, a Trump-Sharaa meeting during the US president’s visit to the region is widely seen as unlikely, given Trump’s packed schedule, his priorities and lack of consensus within Trump’s team on how to tackle Syria.\nA source familiar with ongoing efforts said a high-level Syria-US meeting was set to take place in the region during the week of Trump’s visit, but that it would not be between Trump and Sharaa.\n“There is definitely a push underway,” said Charles Lister, head of the Syria Initiative at the Middle East Institute.\n“The idea is that getting to Trump directly is the best avenue because there are just too many ideologues within the administration to get past.”\nWashington is yet to formulate and articulate a coherent Syria policy, but the administration has increasingly been viewing relations with Damascus from a perspective of counterterrorism, three sources including a US official familiar with the policy-making said.\nThat approach was illustrated by the make-up of the US delegation in a meeting last month between Washington and Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani in New York, which included a senior counterterrorism official from the State Department, two of the sources said.\nUS officials conveyed to Shibani that Washington found steps taken by Damascus to be insufficient, particularly on the US demand to remove foreign fighters from senior posts in the army and expel as many of them as possible, the sources said.\nThe US Treasury has since conveyed its own demands on the Syrian government, bringing the number of conditions to more than a dozen, one of the sources said.\nThe US State Department declined to disclose who attended the meeting from the US side and said it does not comment on private diplomatic discussions.\nWhite House National Security Council spokesperson James Hewitt said the actions of Syria’s interim authorities would determine the future US support or possible sanctions relief.\nA key aim of Syria’s overtures to Washington is communicating that it poses no threat to Israel, which has escalated airstrikes in Syria since the country’s rebels-turned rulers ousted former strongman Bashar al-Assad last year.\nIsrael says the strikes were largely aimed at destroying Syria’s military and chemical arsenal to stop them falling into the hands of the new regime.\nIsrael’s ground forces have also occupied a buffer zone in southwestern Syria along the border, while the government has lobbied the US to keep Syria decentralized and isolated.\nThe IDF described its presence in southern Syria’s buffer zone as a temporary and defensive measure, though Defense Minister Israel Katz has said that troops will remain deployed to nine army posts in the area “indefinitely.”\nIsrael has also said it aims to protect Syrian minority groups. Sectarian violence in Syria has escalated in recent weeks, as Islamist supporters of the country’s new regime have targeted Druze communities in clashes in southern Syria. Reports have put the death toll from the fighting at around 100.\nIsrael has vowed to protect the Syrian Druze community from threats, and the IDF has struck targets in the country as a “warning” to the new regime.\nSyria’s government has condemned Israel’s strikes as escalatory and as foreign interference, and says the new government in Damascus is working to unify the country after 14 years of civil war.\nSharaa last week confirmed indirect negotiations with Israel aimed at calming tensions, after Reuters reported that such talks had occurred via the UAE.\nIn a separate effort, Bass said Sharaa told him to pass messages between Syria and Israel that may have led to a direct meeting between Israeli and Syrian officials.\nBut Israel soon resumed strikes, including one near the presidential palace, which it framed as a message to Syria’s rulers to protect the country’s Druze minority amid clashes with Sunni militants.\n“Sharaa sent the Israelis an olive branch. Israel sent missiles,” Bass said.\n“We need Trump to help sort this relationship out.”\nTimes of Israel staff contributed to this report.",

    "date": "Updated 09:52 AM GMT+5:30, May 12, 2025",
    "article": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday rejected reports of widening gaps between him and US President Donald Trump, and said that his relationship with the president was “excellent” in a video update on his X account.\nThe reports came ahead of Trump’s trip to the Middle East this week, in which the US president will skip Israel but will stop in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, leading government critics to warn Israel was being left out of Washington’s regional diplomatic initiatives.\n“What can I say — it’s not Trump saying it and it’s not me saying it,” Netanyahu said, when asked about sources in the media claiming there is growing tension between Washington and Jerusalem amid the war in Gaza and the US-Iran nuclear talks.\n“It was his [Trump’s] spokesperson at the White House who said: ‘What is this nonsense?’” Netanyahu continued, referring to recent comments from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. “She said the relationship is excellent, and I’m telling you — the relationship is excellent.”\n“These spins — most of them are born here [in Israel.] They’re born in a certain media outlet that’s trying to promote a certain candidate. And in order to promote him, they need to say: ‘Trump and Netanyahu are no longer,’” the premier claimed.\nHe did not name the media outlet.\nמעדכן אתכם >> pic.twitter.com/IQIaxsQIjR\n— Benjamin Netanyahu – בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) May 11, 2025\n“I speak to him [Trump] from time to time. I won’t say every couple of days, but every two or three weeks, I talk to him. My people are in the White House — including just two to three days ago, they were there…We are currently blessed with a president and an administration that is very, very friendly. And we’re trying to coordinate both the big things as well as the small things,” concluded Netanyahu, referring to a visit last week to the White House by Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer.\nUS Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff added his voice to the growing chorus of officials denying any tensions between the two leaders, in an interview with the right-wing Breitbart news site conducted last week and published Sunday evening.\n“Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli people are a staunch ally of the United States, and it goes back the other way,” said Witkoff. “I’ve been at multiple meetings with the president and the prime minister—they’re friendly. They’re good friends, in fact.”\nHe said this does not mean they see eye-to-eye “on absolutely everything,” but that the media “hears about a small disagreement… then conflates that into some large article about massive issues that they have.”\n“Israel is a great partner for the United States, strategically, economically. We think very much alike, we have very similar objectives,” the US envoy said. “They don’t want to see a weaponized nuclear state in the state of Iran. And so, I don’t think there’s much daylight between how they think and how we think from a foreign policy perspective.”\nChannel 12 reported Sunday that Witkoff recently told hostages’ families that he disagrees with Israel’s approach to the war in the Strip, and believes that Israel is pointlessly extending the war when reaching a new ceasefire and hostage release deal is the correct next step to take.\nIsrael is planning to launch a major military offensive against Hamas in Gaza if no hostage deal is reached with the terror group by the end of Trump’s visit to the region.\nChannel 12 cited the families as saying they had not heard this kind of criticism of Israeli government policy from Witkoff in the past.\nFormer US ambassador to Israel David Friedman, who served under the first Trump administration, also asserted in an X post, “There is NO RIFT between President Trump and PM Netanyahu. There are those in both the US and Israel who would like to see such a rift, and they are feeding false accounts to the media to achieve just that. But it’s all fake.”\nThere is NO RIFT between President Trump and PM Netanyahu. There are those in both the US and Israel who would like to see such a rift, and they are feeding false accounts to the media to achieve just that. But it’s all fake.\n— David M Friedman (@DavidM_Friedman) May 11, 2025\nCurrent US Ambassador Mike Huckabee tried to quell the rumors of tensions in interviews with Israeli networks Saturday, asserting that the US president was not snubbing Israel by skipping the Jewish state during his upcoming visit.\nJerusalem is reportedly unhappy with the ongoing US-Iran talks, which are said to be developing into a largely similar framework to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, which was signed by then-US president Barack Obama and was panned at the time by Netanyahu as disastrous for Israel.\nUnder the terms being discussed, according to reports, Iran would limit stockpile size and centrifuge types, and dilute, export, or seal its 60 percent uranium stock under unprecedented International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) scrutiny, in exchange for substantial sanctions relief.\nThis approach has not aligned with Netanyahu’s longtime position, which is that Israel will not allow Iran to attain nuclear weapons and is opposed to any talks that don’t lead Iran to agree to a “Libya-style agreement,” under which Tehran’s entire nuclear program — both military and civilian — would be dismantled completely.\nIn addition, Israel had not been made aware in advance of a recent deal signed between the US and the Houthi rebels in Yemen regarding a cessation of US bombing if the Iran-backed rebels stop firing on US shipping, which notably left the door open for Houthi strikes on Israel to go unabated.\nThat deal was announced by Trump two days after a Houthi missile impacted the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, a few hundred yards from the main control tower, lightly injuring several people and prompting most foreign airlines to halt flights to Israel.\nIsrael’s Channel 13 reported Sunday evening that people in Netanyahu’s inner circle have expressed unusually harsh criticism toward the Trump administration in recent weeks.\n“There’s chaos in the Trump administration — the right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing,” said a senior figure close to the premier, according to the report.\n“It’s not even clear if this has anything to do with us. Everything operates according to the president’s whims. Sometimes that works in our favor, and sometimes it doesn’t,” the source said.\nThe premier’s office also expressed disappointment in the White House through Dermer, during a meeting last Thursday between the top Netanyahu adviser and Trump, the report added.\nפוקס ניוז, ערוץ הבית של טראמפ, מדווחים על המיאוס שלו מנתניהו שמונע לקדם מהלכים באזור. pic.twitter.com/kVotzgbri9\n— Yosef Yisrael (@yosefyisrael25) May 11, 2025\nIn the US, Fox News also reported on the rift, citing analysts as saying Netanyahu stood as a “roadblock” to Trump’s diplomatic initiatives in the region, adding that Israel was not part of securing the expected release of US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, who was kidnapped during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led onslaught that started the war in Gaza.\nOfficials told The Times of Israel the move was a goodwill gesture by Hamas ahead of Trump’s Middle East visit, hoping that he will coax Israel to sign a deal freeing the remaining hostages in exchange for an end to the war.",

Palestinians — including the families of prisoners and slain attackers — will be able to apply for welfare stipends, and bureaucrats will adjudicate whether each applicant will receive payments and how much based on economic criteria, Palestinian and US officials have told The Times of Israel.\nThe transition to the new system has taken time, but last month, senior Palestinian official Hussein al-Sheikh — who has since been formally appointed Abbas’s deputy — penned a letter to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio inviting the Trump administration to send a delegation to Ramallah from June 1 onward in order to certify that the PA has implemented the reform and is in compliance with US legislation that bars American aid that directly benefits the PA so long as its previous prisoner payment system remained in place.\nPalestinian sources told The Times of Israel in March and April that families of prisoners and slain attackers were still receiving stipends based on the old system, as the new system was not in place. But that is no longer the case for at least 1,612 prisoners, who did not receive a stipend for the month of May, the two sources said.\nThe sources did not know what that meant for the thousands of other prisoners and could not elaborate further on the figure.\nCritics argued that the old policy incentivized terror and dubbed it “pay-to-slay.” Palestinian leaders have long defended the stipends, describing them as a form of social welfare and necessary compensation for victims of what they said is Israel’s callous military justice system in the West Bank.\nThough the PA’s reform was largely finalized under the Biden administration, Ramallah decided to hold off on announcing the move, preferring to save it as a goodwill gesture for the incoming Trump administration.",

    "article": "A third-party mediator operated a backchannel between the United States and Hamas that helped secure the agreement to release American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, a source familiar with the matter and a Palestinian official revealed to The Times of Israel on Sunday.\nThe backchannel was operated by a non-governmental individual who passed along messages between Hamas’s leadership in Qatar and US special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, the sources said, while declining to reveal the identity of the person on the record.\nThe backchannel was opened last month, with the person urging Hamas to release Alexander unconditionally, telling the terror group that the move would go a long way with the Trump administration and potentially open the door to Washington coaxing Israel to agree to a deal that would bring about an end to the war in Gaza in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages — a trade Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has until now rejected, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power.\nHamas for weeks pushed back against freeing Alexander unconditionally and presented the third-party backchannel with proposals that would have seen Israel take various steps in exchange for the 21-year-old’s release.\nThe go-between warned Hamas last week that such offers wouldn’t fly and that time was not on the group’s side, with Israel planning to launch a major operation to gradually re-occupy the entire Gaza Strip once US President Donald Trump wraps up his trip to the region on Friday. Trump will depart on Monday for Saudi Arabia before making stops in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. He is not slated to visit Israel on this trip.\nOver the weekend, Hamas informed the go-between that it had agreed to release Alexander unconditionally but wanted Witkoff to know that the step should not be viewed as a one-off, the sources said. Hamas stressed to the mediator that it was ready to work with the Trump administration to secure a permanent ceasefire in Gaza with security arrangements in order to ensure a yearslong calm until a final settlement of the conflict is reached, the sources said.\nHamas also told the US via the backchannel that it needed to locate Alexander. Last month, it released a propaganda video showing Alexander alive. Two days later, the group claimed it had lost contact with his captors after an Israeli airstrike.\nOn Sunday, Hamas told the mediator that it had found Alexander and was prepared to move ahead with his release. The negotiator, in turn told Hamas to inform Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani of the decision. The Qatari premier then called Witkoff to confirm that Alexander’s release would be moving ahead.\nWitkoff then called Netanyahu and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to inform them of the development, the US official said. Israel then agreed to temporary halt some of its military operations, including drone surveillance of the Strip in the lead-up and during Alexander’s release on Monday, the source familiar with the matter said.\nAfter receiving the news from Witkoff, Alexander’s parents took off for Israel from the US on Sunday night and were accompanied by US hostage envoy Adam Boehler.\nNetanyahu’s office issued a statement early Monday morning claiming that Alexander’s release was made possible due to Israel’s military pressure in Gaza. It stressed that Israel did not agree to a ceasefire or to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Alexander — only to provide a safe corridor to allow for his release.\nIn an earlier statement attributed to an “Israeli official,” Netanyahu’s office said that it was still prepared to accept the so-called “Witkoff proposal” through which Hamas agrees to release half of the hostages up front in exchange for a weekslong truce during which the sides agree to hold talks on the terms of a permanent end to the war.\nSuch talks were supposed to have been held during the previous agreement that the sides signed in January, but Netanyahu largely refused to engage in such negotiations, amid pressure from his far-right coalition partners who threatened to collapse his government if he agreed to end the war.\nAccordingly, Hamas has insisted on ironclad guarantees, such as a UN Security Council resolution, in order to ensure that Israel holds those talks and agrees to end the war.\nIn addition to releasing the hostages, Israel is demanding that Hamas dismantle its governing and military capabilities. While the group has said it is prepared to forgo control of the Strip to an independent committee of Palestinian technocrats, it has held off on the demand to permanently disarm.",

    "article": "US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff recently told families of hostages held in Gaza that he disagrees with Israel’s approach to the war in the Strip, and believes reaching a new ceasefire and hostage release deal is the correct next step to take, a report said Sunday, as reports of the growing rift between the US and Israeli leaders mount.\nAccording to Channel 12, Witkoff told the families that the US “wants to return the hostages, but Israel is not ready to end the war.”\n“Israel is prolonging the war, even though we do not see where further progress can be made,” Witkoff said, according to the report, which cited sources who attended the meeting.\n“Still, there is currently a window of opportunity that we hope Israel and all the mediators will take advantage of. We are putting pressure on all the mediators and doing everything to return the hostages,” he reportedly said.\nChannel 12 cited the families as saying they’ve not heard this kind of criticism of Israeli government policy from Witkoff in the past.\nThe report also quoted unnamed senior Israeli officials as issuing a warning: “If there are no agreements by the end of [US President Donald] Trump’s visit to the Middle East, Israel will launch a ground operation and it will take several weeks until the next ‘exit point.’ Once we have begun the intensified operation, we won’t agree to quickly halt it. Hamas will not determine the timeline.”\nEchoing Witkoff’s reported remarks, however, the officials agreed that there was currently “a window of opportunity,” and stated that the mediators have an obligation to make this clear to Hamas, according to Channel 12.\nThe report said Israel was open to various proposals — including what it said Israel is calling a “watered-down Witkoff proposal” — but that if Hamas continues its refusal to agree to a deal, there is “no alternative” to an intensified operation that will not end quickly. What Israel has referred to as the “Witkoff proposal” — which sources told The Times of Israel at the time is in fact more of an Israeli offer — provides for the release of around half of the living hostages in return for an extended truce, followed by the release of the rest of the hostages alongside an end to the war.\nThe network said Witkoff was holding conversations with various key players Sunday night, trying to establish some kind of framework for a deal this week.\nWalla news reported that Witkoff was currently holding talks with Hamas, Qatar, Egypt and Israel on a hostage deal and longer-term calm.\nAfter these reports, the Hamas terror group announced Sunday evening that it would release American-Israeli hostage soldier Edan Alexander, believed to be the last remaining living US citizen held hostage in Gaza, and one of 59 total captives still held by Palestinian terror groups.\nAlexander was taken captive from his tank during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, during which terrorists killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages back to the Strip, sparking the ongoing war. He has been held in Gaza for over 580 days.\nThe Hamas statement, issued ahead of Trump’s trip to the region this week, was meant as a goodwill gesture in the hope that Washington will coax Israel to end the war in Gaza, a source involved in the mediation effort told The Times of Israel.\nThe source said Hamas has received assurances from the US through mediators that Alexander’s release “would go a long way” with Trump, who wants to see the remaining hostages released and for the war in Gaza to end.\nIt was unclear when Alexander would be released, but a source involved in the process told The Times of Israel that the goal was for him to be released early this week, potentially as early as Monday.\nAccording to a source familiar with the negotiations, the US did not brief Israel on the effort to release Alexander until after the deal with Hamas was reached, saying Israel had generally been aware that efforts were ongoing, but only knew about them from its own intelligence operations.\nAccording to a separate Sunday report, Trump and Netanyahu are increasingly at odds with one another over their contrasting visions for the Middle East, and in particular for the Gaza Strip.\nCiting unnamed US officials, NBC reported that Trump is opposed to Netanyahu’s plans for a new, significantly expanded operation in the Gaza Strip, and has privately called it a wasted effort that will interfere with his vision to rebuild the enclave.\nNetanyahu, meanwhile, was said to be growing increasingly frustrated with the US approach to Iran amid the nuclear talks and after Washington struck a deal with the Houthis, agreeing to end its intensive bombing campaign in return for an end to the Iran-backed group’s maritime attacks.\nSpeaking to NBC, one US official said Israel was “worried about any deal” that the US could sign with Iran to thwart its nuclear ambitions.\nTo that end, two US officials said Netanyahu has privately dismissed the negotiations as a waste of time, arguing that even if a deal is forged, Tehran would inevitably break it.\nIsrael would rather take action and strike Iran’s nuclear facilities, the report said, and believes that the opportunity to do so is shrinking further the longer talks continue.\nJerusalem is reportedly unhappy with the ongoing US-Iran talks, which are said to be developing into a largely similar framework to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, which was signed by then-US president Barack Obama and was panned at the time by Netanyahu as disastrous for Israel.\nUnder the terms being discussed, according to reports, Iran would limit stockpile size and centrifuge types, and dilute, export or seal its 60 percent uranium stock under unprecedented International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) scrutiny, in exchange for substantial sanctions relief.\nThis approach has not aligned with Netanyahu’s longtime position, which is that Israel will not allow Iran to attain nuclear weapons and is opposed to any talks that don’t lead Iran to agree to a “Libya-style agreement,” under which Tehran’s entire nuclear program — both military and civilian — would be dismantled completely.\nAnother report on Sunday, this time on Channel 13, said that officials in Netanyahu’s entourage have become increasingly vocal against the Trump administration’s recent decisions regarding the Middle East.\n“There is chaos in the Trump administration, the right foot doesn’t know what the left foot is doing,” a senior official close to the premier said, according to the report. “I’m not sure it has anything to do with us at all. Everything works according to the president’s whims. Sometimes it works in our favor and sometimes it doesn’t.”\nAfter the flurry of reports that the two leaders were at odds, Netanyahu took to social media to set the record straight, saying that his bond with Trump was “excellent.”\n“What can I say — it’s not Trump saying it and it’s not me saying it,” Netanyahu said in a video update on his X account, adding that “the relationship is excellent.”\n“I speak to him [Trump] from time to time. I won’t say every couple of days, but every two or three weeks, I talk to him. My people are in the White House — including just two to three days ago, they were there… We are currently blessed with a president and an administration that is very, very friendly. And we’re trying to coordinate both the big things, as well as the small things,” concluded Netanyahu.",

    "article": "Hamas was set to release American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander on Monday after over 580 days in captivity. The Palestinian terror group agreed to the move as a gesture of goodwill to US President Donald Trump ahead of his trip to the region, hoping that he will in turn coax Israel to sign a deal freeing the remaining hostages in exchange for an end to the war, a US official, a Palestinian official and a third source familiar with the matter told The Times of Israel on Sunday.\nUS special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff called Alexander’s parents Yael and Adi on Sunday afternoon to inform them of the news, a US official said. The Alexanders flew to Israel with US hostage envoy Adam Boehler on Sunday night in order to arrive in time for Alexander’s release. Witkoff was slated to fly to Israel separately from Oman, where he held the fourth round of nuclear talks with Iran on Sunday.\n“The entire family is now on the way to Israel,” Edan’s father, Adi, told the Ynet news site. “We were completely surprised to receive the call from Witkoff. We knew about the negotiations but not about such a dramatic development.”\nBoehler himself tweeted that the news of Alexander’s release was a positive step forward, adding: “We would also ask that Hamas release the bodies of four other Americans that were taken.”\nThe bodies of slain hostages Itay Chen, Omer Neutra, Gadi Haggai and Judith Weinstein Haggai are among the 59 captives still held by Hamas. Up to 24 of those hostages are believed to still be alive.\nHamas has said it is willing to release all of the hostages at once in exchange for an end to the war, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused such an exchange, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power.\nHamas is hoping that releasing Alexander will be enough to convince Trump to push Netanyahu to accept the trade, the source familiar with the matter said.\nThe source added that Hamas was assured by a mediator that Alexander’s release “would go a long way” with Trump, who wants to see the remaining hostages released and for the war in Gaza to end.\nCertain security measures need to be taken in order for the release to move forward, such as Israel halting military operations and drone surveillance of parts of the Strip, as it has had to do in previous releases, a source involved in the process told The Times of Israel.\nAlexander, a dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, was serving in the Israel Defense Forces at the time of his abduction. He was kidnapped from his base during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led onslaught that started the war in Gaza. He is set to be the first male soldier to be released.\nIn a statement, Hamas said the decision to release Alexander came after recent talks with US officials and “intensified efforts to achieve a ceasefire, open border crossings, and allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.”\nOn this Mother’s Day, it is my honor to travel with Edan Alexander’s mom Yael for reunion of her son from Hamas.\nThank you President Trump for your commitment to bringing all Americans home. @POTUS @SecRubio  @SteveWitkoff ❤️❤️❤️ pic.twitter.com/UwcehqJ0xB\n— Adam Boehler (@aboehler) May 12, 2025\nIt did not say when Alexander would be released. The officials who spoke with The Times of Israel said that — contrary to Hamas’s claim — no direct talks were held between the terror group and the US.\nHamas in its statement also said that it was prepared to enter intensified negotiations aimed at reaching a final agreement to end the war, establish a mutually “agreed prisoner exchange, and enable Gaza to be administered by an independent professional authority.”\nHamas uses the term “prisoner exchange” to refer to the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian security prisoners, including terrorists convicted of murdering Israelis.\n“This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones,” Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday evening. “Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict. I look very much forward to that day of celebration!”\nMONUMENTAL NEWS: \"I am happy to announce that Edan Alexander, an American citizen who has been held hostage since October 2023, is coming home to his family.\" –President Donald J. Trump ???????? pic.twitter.com/zTFBzD5rBN\n— The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 11, 2025\nQatar and Egypt welcomed the news in a joint statement, calling it “a gesture of goodwill and an encouraging step toward a return to the negotiating table to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, the release of prisoners and detainees, and ensure the safe and unhindered flow of aid to address the tragic conditions in the Strip.”\nThe US did not brief Israel on the effort to release Alexander until after the deal with Hamas was reached, the source familiar with the details of Alexander’s release told The Times of Israel.\nIsrael was generally aware that efforts were ongoing, but only knew about them from its own intelligence operations. On Sunday evening, Witkoff updated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer about the development, the US official said.\nNetanyahu’s office confirmed that the US had informed Israel that Hamas would release Alexander “without any compensation or conditions,” and as a gesture of goodwill to the US.\n“The US conveyed to Israel that this move is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of additional hostages, based on the original Witkoff proposal — which Israel has already accepted,” said the PMO in a statement, referring to a framework that sources have told The Times of Israel was in fact proposed by Israel, under which around half the living hostages would go free in exchange for an extended truce, with the rest being later freed in exchange for an end to the war.\nIsrael was making preparations for the potential release, the PMO continued, adding that “according to Israeli policy, the negotiation will take place under fire, with a firm commitment to achieving all the objectives of the war.”\nEarlier Sunday, multiple reports quoted Netanyahu as telling the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that Hamas could release Alexander during Trump’s visit, and welcomed the possibility, adding: “These are very critical days.”\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement Sunday that the release of Alexander “must be the start of a single agreement that will return all 59 hostages.”\n“There is only one moral, proper and necessary agreement: the immediate return of all the hostages and the end of the war,” said the forum, which has long been calling for the government to agree to a deal that will return all the remaining hostages at once, rather than in phases.\n“Now is the time to bring about a breakthrough in negotiations. The responsibility lies with the Israeli government,” it added. “Nobody can be left behind.”\nTerror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 59 hostages, including 58 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the IDF.\nHamas released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire between January and March. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. In exchange, Israel has freed some 2,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners, and Gazan terror suspects detained during the war.\nEight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.\nThe body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas, and is counted among the 59 hostages.\nAgencies contributed to this report.",

    "article": "The Israel Defense Forces on Sunday evening issued an “urgent” evacuation warning to the three Houthi-controlled ports in western Yemen, ahead of potential Israeli strikes.\nThe warning came after the Houthis fired several ballistic missiles and drones at Israel in recent days, since the Israeli Air Force struck the Houthi-controlled airport in Sanaa and several other facilities last week in response to a Houthi ballistic missile that impacted inside the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport last Sunday.\nIn a post on X, the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesman Col. Avichay Adraee warned those at the Ras Isa, Hodeidah, and Salif ports on the western coast to evacuate.\n“Due to the Houthi terror regime’s use of ports for its terror activities, we urge all those present at these ports to evacuate and stay away from them for your own safety until further notice,” he said.\nA report by Reuters, citing the Houthi interior ministry, claimed that Israel targeted Hodeidah port following the warning. Israeli military sources said no strikes had been carried out as of Sunday night. There were no reports in Houthi media of strikes either.\nOn Friday afternoon, the Houthis fired a ballistic missile that triggered sirens across central Israel. The IDF reported that the missile was successfully intercepted by air defenses.\n#عاجل تحذير لكل المتواجدين في الموانئ البحرية التي يسيطر عليها النظام الحوثي الإرهابي⭕️ميناء رأس عيسى⭕️ميناء الحديدة⭕️ميناء الصليف\n????أمامكم تحذير هام وعاجل????\nنظرًا لقيام النظام الحوثي الإرهابي باستخدام الموانئ البحرية لصالح أنشطته الإرهابية نحث جميع المتواجدين في هذه الموانئ… pic.twitter.com/3ySkzXCYRR\n— افيخاي ادرعي (@AvichayAdraee) May 11, 2025\nDefense Minister Israel Katz warned then that Israel would respond. “The Houthis continue to launch Iranian missiles at Israel. As we promised, we will respond, strongly in Yemen and anywhere else necessary,” he said in a statement.\nThe Friday attack came three days after the US announced that it had reached a ceasefire with the Yemeni terror group.\nHouthi officials made clear that the deal, in which they agreed to stop targeting US maritime activity in the Red Sea in exchange for an end to weeks of intense US airstrikes, did not include any agreement to stop firing at Israel or ships linked to the Jewish state.\nOn Wednesday, the IDF said a missile fired by the Houthis crashed outside Israeli territory. Earlier in the day, the IDF said it had downed a drone launched from Yemen.\nThe attacks came after Israel carried out two days of heavy sorties targeting infrastructure controlled by the Houthis in response to the missile that struck Ben Gurion Airport. Since Ben Gurion was hit, most foreign airlines have suspended flights to Israel.\nThe fiery reprisals destroyed the international airport in the capital Sanaa, and caused heavy damage to a port in Hodeida and several power stations and a cement factory, officials said.\nThe Houthis — whose slogan calls for “Death to America, Death to Israel, [and] a Curse on the Jews” — first began attacking Israel and maritime traffic in November 2023, a month after the October 7 Hamas massacre.\nThe Houthis held their fire when a ceasefire was reached between Israel and Hamas in January 2025. By that point, they had fired over 40 ballistic missiles and dozens of attack drones and cruise missiles at Israel, including one that killed a civilian and wounded several others in Tel Aviv in July, prompting Israel’s first strike in Yemen.\nSince March 18, when the IDF resumed its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Houthis have launched some 29 ballistic missiles and at least 10 drones at Israel.\nThe sirens warning of missile attacks have sent hundreds of thousands of Israelis rushing to shelters at all hours of the day and night.",

    "date": "Updated 09:44 PM GMT+5:30, May 11, 2025",
    "article": "Iran and the United States wrapped up nuclear talks in Oman on Sunday with no apparent breakthrough and a public standoff over enrichment, but with both sides confirming plans for future negotiations.\nIt was the fourth round of the talks that began a month ago, marking the highest-level contact between the two foes since Washington withdrew in 2018 from a landmark nuclear deal during President Donald Trump’s first term.\nBoth sides had reported progress in the previous three rounds, and on Sunday, Iran said the meeting was “difficult but useful,” while a senior US official said Washington was “encouraged.”\nIn a post on X, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said the talks could help “better understand each other’s positions and to find reasonable and realistic ways to address the differences.”\nBaqaei earlier said negotiators would push for relief from US sanctions.\nThe US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington was “encouraged by today’s outcome and look(s) forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future,” without specifying when.\nBaqaei said that the “next round will be coordinated and announced by Oman.”\nAccording to the US official, the talks were “both direct and indirect, and lasted over three hours.”\n“Agreement was reached to move forward” and “continue working through technical elements,” the official added.\nIran entered the talks saying that its right to maintain uranium enrichment was “non-negotiable,” while Washington’s chief negotiator Steve Witkoff has said that the American demand to stop enrichment is a “red line.”\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led Tehran’s delegation, said in a video before departing for the Omani capital Muscat that “enrichment capability is one of the honors” of Iran.\nThe talks come amid a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region, with Trump heading to the Gulf for his first major foreign tour next week, and Araghchi just back from Saudi Arabia and Qatar.\nThe fourth round that took place on Sunday was initially scheduled for May 3, but was delayed, with mediator Oman citing “logistical reasons.”\nYousuf Al Bulushi, chairman of the Muscat Policy Council think tank, said that a breakthrough “will take quite some time, but I’m optimistic.”\nHe warned, however, that both sides had lost precious time during past negotiations, trying to clarify public statements “instead of focusing solely on talks.”\nPublic pressure “is a tactic in negotiations… but this is really impacting the atmosphere” at the table, said Bulushi.\nWestern countries, including the United States, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, while Tehran insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.\nIran currently enriches uranium to 60-percent purity — far above the 3.67% limit set in the 2015 deal with the United States and other world powers, and a short technical step from the 90% needed for weapons-grade material. Tehran regularly threatens to destroy Israel, and its uranium enrichment level is far higher than necessary for civilian uses.\nWitkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy, said in a Friday interview that Iran’s “enrichment facilities have to be dismantled.”\n“That’s our red line. No enrichment. That means dismantlement. It means no weaponization. And it means that Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan — those are their three enrichment facilities — have to be dismantled,” he told US right-wing outlet Breitbart News, after initially suggesting flexibility on Tehran maintaining low-level enrichment of uranium for civilian purposes.\nAraghchi has repeatedly defended Iran’s right to enrich uranium.\nAt a press conference in Jerusalem on Sunday, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said Iran’s uranium enrichment facilities “must be dismantled,” and that the US and Israel agree on this issue.\n“The most dangerous regime must not be allowed to obtain the world’s most dangerous weapon,” he said.\nSa’ar said he “agrees very much” with comments made over the weekend by Witkoff, who said enrichment facilities “have to be dismantled” for Washington to take it at its word that it does not want nuclear arms.\n“I think this is the right approach and we hold the same view on the matter,” Sa’ar said.\nAsked whether Israel is concerned about recent foreign policy moves by Trump that seemed to sideline Jerusalem on key regional issues, Sa’ar said, “We are coordinated. It doesn’t mean we must fully agree one hundred percent on every issue.”\n“The US is a sovereign state, Israel is a sovereign state. But I believe that we have very, very big common grounds with positions in this US administration, more than in the past…I think the US is our greatest friend and President Trump is a great friend of Israel, and we will work together; we are working together,” he added.\nSa’ar noted that “there is no other world leader” with whom Trump has spent more time than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nNetanyahu, who is deeply skeptical of the Iran-US talks, has called for all of Tehran’s nuclear facilities to be dismantled and for its ballistic missile program to be stopped as part of any credible deal.\nTehran has insisted that the talks be solely focused on the nuclear issue and the lifting of sanctions, ruling out negotiations on military capabilities.\nJerusalem is reportedly unhappy with the state of the talks, which were said to be developing into a largely similar framework to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, which was signed by then-US president Barack Obama and was panned at the time by Netanyahu as disastrous for Israel. Trump also maligned the accord before withdrawing from it in 2018.",

    "article": "The Cannes Film Festival, which begins on Tuesday, will include several movies this year that focus on the war between Israel and the Hamas terror group in Gaza, including a documentary whose protagonist was killed in an Israeli strike last month.\nFatima Hassouna, a 25-year-old Gazan photojournalist, is the main character in Iranian filmmaker Sepideh Farsi’s documentary, “Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk.”\nThe filmmaker, a refugee from Iran, made the movie from video phone calls with Hassouna over more than 200 days of war.\nOn April 15, Farsi rang the young Palestinian to tell her the film had been selected for Cannes, and they immediately started trying to arrange for her to attend the French festival.\nThe next day, an Israeli airstrike killed Hassouna along with 10 relatives in her family home in northern Gaza. Only her mother survived.\nThe Israel Defense Forces said the strike targeted a Hamas operative involved in attacks on soldiers and civilians.\n“Prior to the strike, measures were taken to minimize the risk to civilians, including the use of precision munitions, aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence,” the IDF said.\nAt the time, Cannes said in a statement that it wished “to express its horror and deep sorrow at this tragedy, which has moved and shocked the entire world,” saying the film’s screening would be “a way of honoring the memory of the young woman, a victim like so many others of the war.”\n????Heartbreaking: Fatima Hassouna was a gifted artist, photographer, and journalist — a brave voice from Gaza known for her powerful images and storytelling. Today, Israel killed Fatima and ten of her family members, silencing a lens that showed the world Gaza’s truth. pic.twitter.com/wRfYKiZDAY\n— Gaza Notifications (@gazanotice) April 16, 2025\nThe war in Gaza started on October 7, 2023, when some 5,000 Hamas-led terrorists invaded southern Israel from Gaza, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, 58 of whom are still held in Gaza along with the body of a soldier killed in 2014. Twenty-four of the hostages are officially believed to be alive, though Israel has expressed “grave concern” about three of them.\nFarsi’s documentary is likely to draw attention to the war, at a festival where the conflict was already present last year.\nAt the Berlinale festival in February, British movie star Tilda Swinton lashed out at “internationally enabled mass murder” in Gaza.\nTwo fiction features at Cannes are also likely to spark discussion of the war, in sections parallel to the main competition.\nGazan twin brothers Arab and Tarzan Nasser will screen “Once Upon a Time in Gaza,” a tale of two friends peddling drugs from a falafel shop in 2007. That year, Hamas forcibly took control of the Strip from the Palestinian Authority, which had governed the area after Israel’s unilateral withdrawal in 2005.\nThe film — in the Un Certain Regard section — is the latest from the exiled duo to show at the festival, with several of their earlier works set in Gaza but filmed in Jordan.\nMeanwhile, Israeli director Nadav Lapid, whose work frequently touches on Israeli identity and the conflict with the Palestinians, will be showing “Yes” in the Directors’ Fortnight program. The film is to follow a jazz musician tasked with setting to music a new national anthem in the aftermath of the October 7 attack.",

    "date": "Updated 02:59 PM GMT+5:30, May 11, 2025",
    "article": "US President Donald Trump’s meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh on Tuesday is also set to include Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Syria’s de facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, Arabic media reported Sunday.\nCiting an informed source who declined to be identified, Palestinian newspaper Al-Quds said the Saudi prince “looks forward to Trump’s agreement to the Saudi condition of establishing a Palestinian state.” Trump had said in February that Saudi Arabia was no longer demanding Palestinian statehood as a condition for normalizing ties with Israel, a statement that at the time drew an urgent Saudi denial.\nAccording to the source cited by Al-Quds, Trump had acceded to bin Salman’s request to include the other Arab leaders in the meeting, which will come at the start of Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates between May 13 and 16.\nTrump will not be visiting Israel, whose government accuses both Abbas and Sharaa of supporting terrorism.\nThe US president predicted ahead of his trip that Saudi-Israeli normalization would happen “very quickly,” but in the meantime, he has reportedly dropped normalization with Israel as a condition for progress on Saudi Arabia’s civilian nuclear program.\nIt had been reported Saturday that Trump would announce US recognition of Palestinian statehood, but Washington’s envoy to Israel Mike Huckabee dismissed the report as “nonsense.”\nIsrael-Saudi normalization seemed just around the corner before the Hamas onslaught of October 7, 2023, that started the war in Gaza. Two Israeli ministers made unprecedented state visits to the desert kingdom in the weeks before the shock assault that sparked the war in Gaza. But the prospect of normalization faded as anti-Israel sentiment reached new heights in the Muslim world amid the war.\nDuring his first term, Trump brokered the Abraham Accords normalization agreements between Israel, the UAE, Morocco, Sudan and Bahrain, partly in exchange for Israel backing away from a plan to annex the West Bank, the seat of the Palestinian Authority.\nTrump in his first term also proposed a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that would have seen a truncated Palestinian state established in parts of the West Bank, Gaza and the Negev Desert. The plan was rejected outright by both the PA and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s pro-settler coalition partners.\nIsrael has long accused the PA of inciting violence against Jews in its school system and through stipends paid to families of Palestinian terrorists detained in Israeli prisons. Abbas ordered an end to the so-called play-to-play system in February, less than a month after Trump took office for the second time.\nThe meeting in Riyadh on Tuesday comes as Trump has reportedly expressed frustration over the failure to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, which has been devastated over 19 months of war. The PA had previously threatened to cut ties with Trump over a plan he announced in February to take over Gaza, oust its residents and rebuild the devastated Strip as a coastal resort.\nA rival Egyptian plan for postwar Gaza would have ultimately handed the Strip over to the PA, but Netanyahu has rejected any role for the unpopular body in Gaza’s postwar governance.\nSeparately, Israel has maintained troop presence and carried out military strikes in southern Lebanon following the ceasefire with Hezbollah in November, and ib the Syrian side of the Golan Heights following Sharaa’s ouster in December of Syria’s Iran-backed president Bashar al-Assad. Both Lebanese President Aoun and Syria’s Sharaa have demanded that Israel withdraw from their respective countries.",

    "subheading": "Washington said to press Israel for ceasefire in Gaza war, which is insurmountable obstacle to normalization; US president’s visit to kingdom to focus on economic, security ties",
    "date": "Updated 02:49 PM GMT+5:30, May 11, 2025",
    "article": "When US President Donald Trump lands in Riyadh on Tuesday, he will be greeted with opulent ceremonies, gilded palaces, and the prospect of $1 trillion in investments. But the raging war in Gaza has denied him one goal he has long craved: Saudi-Israel normalization.\nBehind the scenes, US officials are quietly pressing Israel to agree to an immediate ceasefire in Gaza — one of Saudi Arabia’s preconditions for any restart of normalization talks, said two Gulf sources close to official circles and a US official.\nTrump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff told an audience at the Israeli embassy in Washington this week that he imminently expected progress on expanding the Abraham Accords, a set of deals brokered by Trump in his first term under which several Arab states — the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco — recognized Israel.\nHowever, opposition by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a permanent stop to the war or to the creation of a Palestinian state makes progress on similar talks with Riyadh unlikely, two of the sources said.\n“We think we will have some or a lot of announcements very, very shortly, which we hope will yield progress by next year,” Witkoff said in a video of his speech. He is expected to accompany Trump on his visit to the Middle East.\nSaudi Arabia does not recognize Israel as legitimate, meaning the Middle East’s two most advanced economies and military powers do not have formal diplomatic ties. Supporters of normalizing relations say it would bring stability and prosperity to the region, while countering Iran’s influence.\nEstablishing ties has become especially toxic for Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered on October 7, 2023, when the Palestinian terror group Hamas led a devastating invasion of southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 taken as hostages to Gaza.\nAs such, the issue, central to bilateral talks in Trump’s first term, has effectively been delinked from economic and other security matters between Washington and the kingdom, according to six other sources Reuters spoke with for this story, including two Saudi and two US officials. The people all asked to remain anonymous to speak about sensitive diplomatic conversations.\nSaudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, needs the Gaza war to end and a credible path to a Palestinian state “before he re-engages with the issue of normalization,” said Dennis Ross, a former US negotiator.\nIn the meantime, Washington and Riyadh will focus Trump’s trip largely on the economic partnership and other regional matters, according to the six sources. Lucrative investments such as major deals in arms, mega-projects and artificial intelligence are in play, officials from both sides stressed.\nThe approach was cemented in diplomatic talks between Saudi and US officials ahead of the trip, the first formal state visit of Trump’s second term, they said.\nTrump’s stated aim is to secure a trillion-dollar investment in US companies, building on an initial commitment of $600 billion pledged by the crown prince.\nThe wealthy kingdom, the world’s top oil exporter, knows the ritual well: dazzle the guest, secure the favor. The goal, the sources told Reuters, is to evade diplomatic landmines and perhaps, one said, to win concessions from Trump on the Gaza war and its aftermath.\n“The Trump administration wants this trip to be a big deal. That means lots of splashy deal announcements and collaborations that can be sold as being good for America,” said Robert Mogielnicki, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute, a think tank in Washington.\n“Normalizing ties with Israel is a much heavier lift than rolling out the red carpet for President Trump and announcing investment deals,” he said.\nA State Department spokesperson declined to comment on any understanding reached ahead of the trip, saying Trump “will look to strengthen ties between the United States and our Arab Gulf partners during the visits.”\nThe Saudi government communications office did not reply to a request for comment.\nBefore Hamas launched its October 7 attacks on Israel, the crown prince was finalizing a landmark diplomatic agreement: a US defense pact in exchange for Riyadh recognizing Israel.\nBut the scale of Israel’s campaign to destroy Hamas, topple its Gaza regime, and free the hostages forced a pause in the talks.\nThe Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 50,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though the toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between civilians and fighters.\nIsrael says it has killed some 20,000 combatants in battle as of January and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.\nIn November last year, bin Salman accused Israel of genocide.\nFrustrated by the impact of Gaza’s prolonged crisis on normalization efforts, Trump could use his visit to unveil a US framework to end the 18-month war, the two Gulf sources said.\nThe plan could create a transitional government and new security arrangements for postwar Gaza, potentially reshaping regional diplomacy and opening the door to future normalization talks, they said.\nUnderscoring the high-stakes diplomacy underway, Trump met privately with Israel’s Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer on Thursday to discuss the war and nuclear talks with Iran, Axios reported.\nThe US State Department did not immediately respond to questions about Trump’s discussions on Gaza.\nTrump conspicuously has not announced a visit to Israel as part of his tour of the region. Two diplomats noted the US president has recently refrained from talking about his “Gaza Riviera” plan, which enraged the Arab world with the suggestion of resettling the entire Gazan population and US ownership of the strip.\nIn the build-up to the trip, Washington has taken a number of actions that are positive for Saudi Arabia. An agreement to stop US bombing of the Houthis in Yemen is in line with a Saudi ceasefire there. Washington has also delinked civil nuclear talks from the normalization question.\nThe stalled Saudi-US defense pact, initially conceived as a formal treaty, was revived in the scaled-back form of security guarantees late in the Biden presidency to bypass congressional opposition.\nThe Trump administration has now picked up those talks, along with the discussions about a civilian nuclear agreement, three of the sources said, while cautioning that it will take time to define terms.\nTrump’s Saudi trip is his first formal state visit and second foreign trip since his re-election, after attending the pope’s funeral in Rome. He will also visit Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\nBeneath the showmanship of Trump’s visits, diplomats say, lies also a calculated US effort to reassert influence and reshape economic alignments in a region where Beijing — Washington’s chief economic rival — has steadily expanded its foothold at the heart of the petrodollar system.\nTrump’s first trip abroad in his first term also began in Riyadh, where he unveiled $350 billion in Saudi investments.\nTrump commands deep trust from the Saudi leadership, rooted in the close ties during his first term — a period defined by large arms deals and steadfast US backing for bin Salman, even as global outrage erupted over the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul.\nSaudi Arabia and its Gulf allies now plan to urge Trump to ease US regulations that have increasingly deterred foreign investment, particularly in sectors deemed part of America’s “critical national infrastructure,” five industry sources said.\nIn meetings with US officials, Saudi ministers will advocate for a more business-friendly climate, especially at a time when China is aggressively courting Gulf capital, the industry sources said.\nWhile countering China’s economic rise may top Trump’s foreign policy agenda, it won’t be easy in Saudi Arabia. Since the launch of Vision 2030, China has become integral to the kingdom’s plans, dominating sectors from energy and infrastructure to renewables.",

    "subheading": "International Criminal Court chief prosecutor heard of allegations against him just weeks before seeking arrest of Netanyahu and then-defense minister Gallant",
    "date": "Updated 02:26 PM GMT+5:30, May 11, 2025",
    "article": "International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan allegedly forced sexual intercourse upon a member of staff on multiple occasions, the Wall Street Journal said Saturday, in a report that questioned whether the allegations may have prompted his decision to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-defense minister Yoav Gallant.\nThe report said that at the time — weeks after the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, onslaught — Khan was coming under increasing pressure to take action over Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, and that he had been lashing out at his team.\nA Malaysian lawyer in her 30s reportedly asked to meet with Kahn to ask him to change the manner in which he interacted with the staff. In response, he summoned her to his suite in the Millennium Hilton Hotel next to the UN headquarters in New York.\nAccording to the report, the woman testified to UN officials that Khan started to touch her in a sexual manner, something that she said had been occurring for a number of months.\n“She said she attempted to leave the room several times, but he took her hand and eventually pulled her to the bed. Then he pulled off her pants and forced sexual intercourse, according to the testimony,” the report said.\n“He always holds on to me and leads me to the bed,” she said in testimony reviewed by the Journal. “It’s the feeling of being trapped.”\nThe report said the woman, a married mother, claimed it was one of multiple incidents of “coerced sexual intercourse” but that she stayed in the job because she felt it was an important role in human rights, and she was additionally paying for medical care for her mother. The report said she also began to fear retaliation if she were to complain.\nThe woman alleged that Khan carried out “nonconsensual sex acts” in New York, Colombia, Congo, Chad, and Paris, as well as at a residence owned by his wife in The Hague, the report said.\nKhan, through his lawyers, told the newspaper that it is “categorically untrue that he has engaged in sexual misconduct of any kind.”\nThe newspaper said that just two and a half weeks after Khan learned of the allegations, on May 20, 2024, he announced his intention to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant over the war in Gaza, in addition to Hamas leaders. The day before, he had canceled a fact-finding mission to Israel and Gaza for which he had pressed then-US secretary of state Anthony Blinken to convince Israel to grant him access to Gaza, the report said, citing a May 3, 2024, phone call between the two. According to the newspaper, it was at that time that Khan found out about the allegations against him.\n“The timing of the announcement has spurred questions about whether Khan was aiming to protect himself from the sexual-assault allegations. The day before announcing the warrant application, Khan abruptly canceled a trip to Israel and Gaza that he had previously said was important to make his decision,” the report said.\nAccording to the Journal, Alan Dershowitz had been organizing a meeting that was set to take place during the trip between Khan and Netanyahu.\nLawyers for Khan denied any connection between the allegations and the warrants.\nKhan said the fact that the ICC judges approved the warrants shows that the evidence for them “met the rigorous legal threshold required.” The report also noted that already in March 2024, Khan had notified US State Department officials that he intended to seek the arrest warrants, and that was before the allegations were made against him.\nHowever, court officials told the newspaper that the arrest warrants ensured support for Khan from anti-Israel countries if the allegations were to become public and additionally discouraged his accuser from coming forward.\nThe woman allegedly told investigators that Khan had informed her that her accusations would harm the investigation into the Gaza war.\n“Think about the Palestinian arrest warrants,” she said he told her, according to her testimony.\nThe woman, a Muslim, was said to support investigations of Netanyahu, Gallant, and Hamas. She reportedly later told colleagues she didn’t want to harm the arrest warrant process by filing a complaint. On April 29 of that year, she eventually told officials about the alleged assaults, and on May 5, the ICC’s internal investigation agency contacted her.\nOn November 24, 2024, the ICC issued warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. The Prime Minister’s Office panned the move in a statement as an “antisemitic decision” and asserted that it stemmed from Khan’s efforts to “save his skin from the serious charges against him for sexual harassment” as well as the beliefs of “biased judges motivated by antisemitic hatred of Israel.”\nICC Warrants were also issued against three Hamas leaders, all of whom have since been killed by Israel.\nLast month, it was reported that United Nations investigators examining the allegations of sexual misconduct were also looking into allegations that Khan retaliated against staff who reported the allegations or were critical of his handling of the matter.\nKhan has alleged that the accusations against him were part of an effort to undermine the ICC. The Journal report said that court officials were concerned that the Mossad was operating at The Hague. No further details were given.\nKhan remains in his position. The ICC did not respond to a Journal request for comment.",

    "date": "Updated 05:05 AM GMT+5:30, May 11, 2025",
    "article": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AFP) — During his nine years living in Tennessee, Fahd, a Saudi national, found comfort and consistency at Dunkin’, where he placed the same order every day.\nNow back in Riyadh, Fahd is doing something similar, highlighting the Saudi Arabian love affair with all things American that many find surprising.\n“When I came here, thank God, the same cafe and same order were here too,” said the 31-year-old mechanical engineer, who did not want to give his family name. “I started living the same lifestyle here as I did in America.”\nSaudi Arabia, often known for its religious austerity, is home to Islam’s holiest sites and welcomes millions of Muslim pilgrims every year.\nIt also has — as just one example — more than 600 branches of Dunkin’ (formerly Dunkin’ Donuts), serving roughly 250,000 of its 35-million population each day, according to the US franchise.\nDespite its image as a cloistered and traditional society, life in Saudi Arabia is awash in Western corporate influence, especially from American companies.\nBuffalo Wild Wings, Chuck-e-Cheese and Starbucks populate Riyadh’s sprawl of office parks and shopping centers, while the capital’s traffic-clogged streets heave with hulking American SUVs and pickup trucks.\nThe nations have shared a tight bond since King Abdulaziz bin Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, and US president Franklin Roosevelt shook hands onboard a US cruiser in the Suez Canal during the final months of World War II.\nIn the ensuing decades, the United States has been at the forefront of providing military protection in return for privileged access to Saudi Arabia’s colossal oil reserves.\nThe Saudi riyal is pegged to the greenback and US leaders have been regular guests, including Donald Trump, who arrives in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday on the first major overseas trip of his second term.\nThe relationship has faced rough patches — including the oil embargo in the 1970s, the September 11, 2001, terror attacks carried out by mostly Saudi hijackers, and the gruesome murder of US-based dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul in 2018.\nBut for Saudis, the ties that bind, including a love of American food, cars and movies, remain strong — even after a grassroots campaign to boycott US products that has swept the region during the Israel-Hamas war.\n“The one thing we never disagree on is going to an American restaurant — especially Buffalo Wild Wings,” Dalal Abdulaziz, 28, told AFP, saying that chicken wings were one of her favorite foods.\n“You’ll find American restaurants in every neighborhood here. We eat it weekly, almost like Saudi food.”\nKhaled Salman Al-Dosari agrees, saying it is hard to find a single street in Saudi Arabia without an American brand on offer.\n“American companies’ products have become an inseparable part of our day,” added the 21-year-old student in Riyadh.\nWhile many American companies have been in Saudi Arabia for decades, its Vision 2030 agenda — the oil-dependent country’s giant economic diversification plan — has opened it up and paved the way for further investment.\nLive music and cinemas were all forbidden until recent years, but MMA fights and US professional wrestling are now among the entertainment offers available to Saudi consumers.\n“I think many Americans would be surprised at the extent to which American brands are all over Saudi Arabia,” said Andrew Leber from the Department of Political Science at Tulane University.\nSome see further correlations in terms of climate, architecture — dry, dusty Riyadh, with its wide concrete boulevards, evokes an Arab Dallas — and even mindset.\n“Texas is close to Riyadh in terms of climate,” said Fahd, the mechanical engineer. “And its people are conservative like us.”\nMeanwhile, the Saudi taste for US products has benefits for the tens of thousands of Americans working in the kingdom, many of them in the oil industry.\n“It always… reminds me of home and keeps that connection with the places that I’ve seen since I’ve been growing up,” said Joshua Dunning, a 36-year-old American business developer working at a Saudi tech firm.\n“It’s always a nice reminder.”",

    "date": "Updated 04:27 AM GMT+5:30, May 11, 2025",
    "article": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Saturday that if the United States’ goal was to deprive Iran of its “nuclear rights,” Tehran would never back down on that front.\nAraghchi was speaking in Doha a day ahead of another round of planned nuclear talks between Iran and the US in Oman.\n“If the goal of the negotiations is to deprive Iran of its nuclear rights, I state clearly that Iran will not back down from any of its rights,” state media quoted Araghchi as saying.\nIran has repeatedly said its right to enrich uranium is non-negotiable and has ruled out a “zero enrichment” demand by some US officials.\nBut US President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said in an interview on Friday that Iran’s “enrichment facilities have to be dismantled” under any accord with the United States.\nTrump, who withdrew Washington from a 2015 deal between Tehran and world powers meant to curb its nuclear activity, has threatened to bomb Iran if no new deal is reached to resolve the long-unresolved dispute.\nWestern countries say Iran’s nuclear program, which Tehran accelerated after the US walkout from the now moribund 2015 accord, is geared toward producing weapons, whereas Iran insists it is purely for civilian purposes. However, Tehran regularly threatens to flatten Israeli cities and is currently enriching uranium to levels that have no civilian use.\n“In its indirect talks with the United States, Iran emphasizes its right to peaceful use of nuclear energy and clearly declares that it is not seeking nuclear weapons,” Araghchi claimed.\n“Iran continues negotiations in good faith, and if the goal of these talks is to ensure the non-acquisition of nuclear weapons, an agreement is possible. However, if the aim is to limit Iran’s nuclear rights, Iran will never retreat from its rights.”\nWitkoff was set to travel to Oman on Sunday for the fourth round of Omani-mediated talks with Araghchi, a source familiar with the matter said. The fourth round of negotiations, initially scheduled for May 3 in Rome, was postponed, with mediator Oman citing “logistical reasons.”\nAraghchi visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar on Saturday, a day before the fourth round of negotiations and days before Trump is expected to visit those countries. Trump is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates from May 13 to 16 on his first major Middle East trip of his second term. The president is not expected to visit Israel on the trip.\nTrump provoked Araghchi’s ire earlier this month by indicating that the US would decide what to call the Persian Gulf, following reports that Washington could officially rename it the Gulf of Arabia. Araghchi condemned the decision as showing “hostile intent toward Iran and its people.”\nAhead of the trip, Trump had predicted that Saudi-Israel normalization would happen “very quickly.” However, sources cited by Reuters have said Trump has dropped the demand that Saudi Arabia normalize relations with Israel as a condition for progress on a civil nuclear program.\nJacob Magid and agencies contributed to this report.",

    "article": "Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa has said he’s sought assistance from Israel and the United Arab Emirates to combat the drug cartels that are terrorizing the South American country.\nIn an interview in Paris on Thursday night, the iron-fisted 37-year-old who won reelection last month said Israel and the UAE have agreed to provide intelligence “to help” fight cocaine traffickers.\nOnce-peaceful Ecuador averaged a killing every hour at the start of the year, as cartels battle for control over cocaine routes that pass through the nation’s ports.\nDuring presidential campaigning, Noboa suggested US special forces should be deployed to Ecuador to tackle the violence and floated legal reforms to allow US bases to reopen.\nOver the past week, he traveled to Italy, Spain, Britain and France — some of the European countries experiencing rocketing cocaine consumption — to develop further security alliances, as well as Israel and the United Arab Emirates.\nHe said he spoke to Israeli and Emirati leaders about “cooperation on security at ports and borders… since the violence is there, in the areas or on the routes to the ports.”\nBut Noboa admitted that “there is not much interest so far” from foreign powers in establishing military bases in the Andean country.\nIn March, he announced a security alliance with Erik Prince, founder of the controversial American security company Blackwater, whose employees killed and wounded dozens of civilians in Iraq.\nAsked about the pact, Noboa said Prince was merely acting in a “consultancy” capacity.\nAfter a close-run race in the first round of Ecuador’s election Noboa easily defeated left-wing lawyer Luisa Gonzalez in April’s run-off.\nWhile Gonzalez had pitched herself as a political everywoman who would improve the lot of poor Ecuadorans, Noboa — heir to a banana export empire — staked his political fortunes on his war on the cartels.\nIn March, he announced a preemptive amnesty for security forces fighting gangs in the violence-wracked port of Guayaquil, despite allegations of gross rights abuses by the military particularly.\nHis tough talk appeared to pay off, with the incumbent taking an 11-point lead over his rival.\nGonzalez rejected the results as fraudulent, without providing proof of her claim.\nNoboa said his win was a “vote of confidence” in his policies.\nHe faces a tough task to unite a country grappling with its dramatic decline in fortunes.\nRampant bloodshed has spooked investors and tourists alike, fueling economic malaise and swelling the ranks of Ecuador’s poor to 28 percent of the population.\n“More than anything, we need to attract foreign investment,” Noboa said.\nBut in order to access bond markets, the government needs to lower its country’s risk factor.\nNoboa assured that Ecuador’s economic fundamentals were “not bad,” citing low inflation and record bank deposits, among other indicators.\n“Our focus is job creation,” he said.",

    "headline": "Pope Leo XIV lays out his vision and identifies AI as a main challenge for humanity",
    "subheading": "Leo indicates intent to maintain some of the core priorities of Pope Francis while also charting his own path",
    "date": "Updated 07:41 PM GMT+5:30, May 10, 2025",
    "article": "VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Leo XIV laid out the vision of his papacy Saturday, identifying artificial intelligence as one of the most critical matters facing humanity and vowing to continue with some of the core priorities of Pope Francis.\nBut in a sign he was making the papacy very much his own, Leo made his first outing since his election to a sanctuary south of Rome that is dedicated to the Madonna and is of particular significance to his Augustinian order.\nTownspeople of Genazzano gathered in the square outside the main church housing the Madre del Buon Consiglio (Mother of Good Counsel) sanctuary as Leo arrived in a car, flanked by Vatican security. The sanctuary, which is managed by Augustinian friars, has been a place of pilgrimage since the 15th century, and Leo visited it last year.\nThe after-lunch outing came after Leo presided over his first formal audience, with the cardinals who elected him pope. In it, Leo repeatedly cited Francis and the Argentine pope’s own 2013 mission statement, making clear a commitment to making the Catholic Church more inclusive and attentive to the faithful and a church that looks out for the “least and rejected.”\nLeo, the first American pope, told the cardinals that he was fully committed to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, the 1960s meetings that modernized the church. He identified AI as one of the main issues facing humanity, saying it poses challenges to defending human dignity, justice and labor.\nLeo referred to AI in explaining the choice of his name: His namesake, Pope Leo XIII, was pope from 1878 to 1903 and laid the foundation for modern Catholic social thought. He did so most famously with his 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum, which addressed workers’ rights and capitalism at the dawn of the industrial age. The late pope criticized both laissez-faire capitalism and state-centric socialism, giving shape to a distinctly Catholic vein of economic teaching.\nIn his remarks Saturday, Leo said he identified with his predecessor, who addressed the great social question of the day posed by the industrial revolution in the encyclical.\n“In our own day, the church offers everyone the treasury of its social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice and labor,” he said.\nToward the end of his pontificate, Francis became increasingly vocal about the threats to humanity posed by AI and called for an international treaty to regulate it. He warned that such powerful technology risks turning human relations into mere algorithms. Francis brought his message to the Group of Seven industrialized nations when he addressed their summit last year, insisting AI must remain human-centric so that decisions about when to use weapons or even less lethal tools always remain made by humans and not machines.\nThe late Argentine pope also used his 2024 annual peace message to call for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, arguing that a technology lacking human values of compassion, mercy, morality and forgiveness is too perilous to develop unchecked.\nFrancis favored the Chicago-born Augustinian missionary Robert Prevost. He moved him to take over a small Peruvian diocese in 2014, where Prevost later became bishop and head of the Peruvian bishops conference, and then called him to Rome to take over one of the most important Vatican offices vetting bishop nominations in 2023.\nThe Vatican revealed Saturday that Leo would retain the motto and coat of arms that he had as bishop of Chiclayo, Peru. The motto, “In Illo uno unum,” was pronounced by St. Augustine in a sermon to explain that “although we Christians are many, in the one Christ we are one.”\nIn the speech, delivered in Italian in the Vatican’s synod hall – not the Apostolic Palace – Leo made repeated references to Francis and the mourning over his death. He held up Francis’s 2013 mission statement, “The Joy of the Gospel,” as something of his own marching orders.\nHe cited Francis’s insistence on the missionary nature of the church and the need to make its leadership more collegial. He cited the need to pay attention to what the faithful say, “especially in its most authentic and inclusive forms, especially popular piety.”\nAgain, referring to Francis’s 2013 mission statement, Leo cited the need for the church to express “loving care for the least and rejected” and engage in courageous dialogue with the contemporary world.\nGreeted by a standing ovation, Leo read from his prepared text, only looking up occasionally. Even when he first appeared to the world on Thursday night, Leo read from a prepared, handwritten text that he must have drafted sometime before his historic election or the hour or so after. He seemed most comfortable speaking off-the-cuff in the few words he pronounced in Spanish.\nPrevost was elected the 267th pontiff on Thursday on the fourth ballot of the conclave, an exceptionally fast outcome given this was the largest and most geographically diverse conclave in history and not all cardinals knew one another before arriving in Rome.\nCardinals have said Prevost did not make any major speech during the pre-conclave discussions, and he carried into the conclave the traditional taboo precluding a pope from the United States, given America’s superpower status. But Prevost was already known to many.\nThey said he made an impression in smaller groups where English was the key language of communication in a conclave that brought together 133 cardinals from 70 countries.\nMadagascar Cardinal Désiré Tsarahazana told reporters on Saturday that on the final ballot, Prevost had received “more” than 100 votes. That suggests an extraordinary margin, well beyond the two-thirds, or 89 votes, necessary to be elected.\nCardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state who had been considered one of the top contenders to be pope, offered his congratulations on Saturday in a letter published in his hometown paper, Il Giornale di Vicenza.\nParolin praised Leo’s grasp of today’s problems, recalling his first words from the loggia when he spoke of the need for a peace that is “disarmed and disarming.” Parolin said he had appreciated Prevost’s leadership in Chiclayo, saying he helped handle a particularly thorny problem — with no details — and grew to appreciate his governance more closely at the Vatican, handling the bishops’ office.\nSpecifically, Parolin praised Leo’s understanding of people and situations, his “calmness in argumentation, balance in proposing solutions, respect, care and love for everyone.”",

    "article": "The Israeli military said Saturday that it was close to defeating all remaining Palestinian terror operatives in southern Gaza’s Rafah, with fighting now only taking place in the Janina neighborhood.\nTroops of the Golani Brigade have been operating in Janina in recent days. The Israel Defense Forces said the soldiers had destroyed terror infrastructures, located dozens of tunnel shafts and killed dozens of operatives.\n“Janina is the last area where fighting against terrorists in the Rafah Brigade is taking place,” the military said.\nFour IDF soldiers have been killed and several others have been wounded during fighting in the Janina area in the past week.\nMeanwhile, the military said that over the past day, the Israeli Air Force had struck some 60 terror targets across the Gaza Strip. Hamas authorities reported 23 killed and dozens more wounded in the previous 24 hours.\nIn the Strip’s north, the IDF said troops of the 252nd Division killed two gunmen who approached forces; in the Morag Corridor area, the 36th Division struck a booby-trapped building where several operatives were located; and in Rafah, Gaza Division forces destroyed Hamas infrastructure both above and below ground.\nGaza’s Hamas-run civil defense agency said that five people were killed in an Israeli strike on a tent in Gaza City — all members of a single family, according to relatives. The figures could not be verified and did not differentiate between civilians and fighters.\n“Three children, their mother and her husband were sleeping inside a tent and were bombed by an [Israeli] occupation aircraft,” family member Omar Abu al-Kass told AFP. The strikes came “without warning and without [them] having done anything wrong,” Abu al-Kass alleged, saying he was the children’s maternal grandfather.\nImages from the scene showed mourners, some of them weeping, gathering alongside five white shrouds of different sizes.\nThe Israeli army, which resumed its offensive in Gaza on March 18 after a two-month truce, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the strike. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.\nOn Saturday morning, the army said that nine IDF soldiers, including two senior officers, were lightly wounded by an explosive device in Gaza City’s Shejaiya neighborhood overnight.\nThe troops of the Jerusalem Brigade were carrying out scans in Shejaiya when the blast went off. Among the wounded were the commander of the Jerusalem Brigade’s 6310th Battalion and the deputy commander of the 252nd Division. All were taken to a hospital in good condition, the army said.\nSources close to Hamas said Friday that a delegation from the terror group held two meetings with Egyptian and Qatari mediators in Doha this week, but they produced no breakthrough in the search for a Gaza truce.\nThe developments come as Israel and the US look to resume aid deliveries to Gaza while preventing food, medicine and other basic items from being hoarded by Hamas, as they say the terror group has repeatedly done with past supplies.\nIsrael stopped allowing aid into Gaza on March 2 after the first phase of a ceasefire and hostage release deal concluded.\nFor weeks, UN agencies and other humanitarian organizations have warned of dwindling supplies of everything from fuel and medicine to food and clean water in the coastal territory that is home to 2.4 million Palestinians.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that US President Donald Trump expressed frustration with his promised tasks of ending the wars in Ukraine and Gaza in a meeting with top donors in Florida last week.\nCiting people who were in the room, the report said that Trump had said finding a solution in Gaza was difficult because “they’d been fighting for a thousand years.”",

    "article": "JTA — Margot Friedlander, a Holocaust survivor who grew prominent in Germany when she returned from the United States decades after surviving the Holocaust, recently died, aged 103.\nThe Margot Friedlander Foundation announced her death on Friday, just weeks after opening applications for a 25,000 euro prize to recognize efforts to fight antisemitism and promote democracy. Friedlander was known for her concern about the rise of the political far right in Germany, as well as her impeccable style and the mantra she promoted: “Be human.”\nFriedlander had appeared less than two days before her death at Berlin’s commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and the rule of the Nazi Party. There, she read from her story, as she had countless times to student groups, public gatherings and public officials.\nFriedlander was born and raised in Berlin and hid there after the Nazis rose to power and began deporting and murdering Jews. She was apprehended in April 1944 and sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp, where she remained until its liberation a year later. Her entire family had been murdered.\nFriedlander and her husband, whom she met in Theresienstadt, moved to New York City, where they lived an unassuming life in Queens. But after her husband’s death in 1997, she began writing about her Holocaust experience, ultimately catching the eye of a filmmaker who brought her to Germany over the course of making a documentary about her.\nThe trip, which Friedlander had once sworn never to make, changed her life. She moved back permanently in 2010, at age 89, and quickly became a local celebrity, according to a Forward profile that appeared three years after her arrival. She made hundreds if not thousands of appearances to tell her story, taking center stage in a country haunted by its Holocaust history.\nIn 2023, she met with then-Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff during his visit to Berlin. She also presented a prize to Guy Nattiv and Helen Mirren, the director and star of “Golda,” the biopic about Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.\nLast year, according to a Vogue Germany cover story, “she was invited to a member of the Bundestag’s party at Soho House and celebrated until the lights came back on.” That fall, she met with then-US president Joe Biden in Berlin.\n102-year-old Holocaust survivor Margot Friedländer is featured on the July/August cover of Vogue Germany. Margot was born in Berlin in 1921. Her entire family was murdered during the Holocaust, leaving Margot as the only survivor. One of the last things Margot’s mother said to… pic.twitter.com/r1jCChu7T1\n— Humans of Judaism (@HumansOfJudaism) June 20, 2024\n“Margot Friedländer, you are a voice of conscience and healing,” Biden said, according to a White House transcript. “I’m actually honored to be in your presence, for real.”\nIn an interview last year, Friedlander was told that many people’s eyes light up when they hear her name. Asked what makes her eyes light up, she offered an immediate answer: “That it seems like I achieved something.”",

    "article": "ISLAMABAD/JAMMU, India (Reuters) — US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that India and Pakistan had agreed to a “full and immediate ceasefire” after a fourth day of strikes and counter-strikes against each other’s military installations.\nPakistan’s foreign minister also said both countries had agreed to a ceasefire “with immediate effect.” His Indian counterpart confirmed the deal as well.\n“After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\nThe announcement came on a day when fears that the countries’ nuclear arsenals might come into play spiked as the Pakistani military said a top military and civil body overseeing its nuclear weapons would meet.\nBut the Pakistani defense minister later said no such meeting was scheduled.\nAt the same time, officials from both sides showed a willingness, for now, to take a step back following the day’s exchanges, while the civilian death toll on both sides of the border mounted to 66.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the agreement followed extensive negotiations by him and Vice President JD Vance with Indian and Pakistani prime ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif and other top officials.\n“I am pleased to announce the Governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site,” Rubio said on X.\n“We commend Prime Ministers Modi and Sharif on their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace,” he added.\nThe ceasefire deal follows weeks of clashes, missile and drone strikes across their borders that were triggered by a gun massacre of tourists last month that India blamed on Pakistan, which denied the charge.\nPakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar announced the ceasefire on Geo News. He said Saudi Arabia and Turkey played an important role in facilitating the deal.\nIndian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said the heads of military operations from both countries spoke Saturday afternoon.\n“It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all firing and military action on land, and in the air and sea. Instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to this understanding.” The top military officials would speak again on May 12, Misri added.\nThe deal has brought a swift conclusion to the most serious military confrontation between the nuclear-armed rivals in decades.\nTensions soared since an attack at a popular tourist site in India-controlled Kashmir left 26 civilians dead, mostly Indian Hindu tourists, on April 22.\nThe countries have fought several wars over the Muslim-majority Kashmir, which both claim in full but administer separate portions since gaining independence from British rule in 1947. Armed groups have stepped up operations in Kashmir since 2019, when Modi’s Hindu nationalist government revoked its limited autonomy and took the state under direct rule by New Delhi.\nThe conflict caused major disruptions to international aviation, with airlines having to cancel flights or use longer routes that do not overfly the India-Pakistan frontier.\nIndia closed 32 airports, while schools in areas close to the border on both sides were shuttered, affecting millions of children.\nIn recent years, India has been seen as a partner by Western powers to counter China’s rising influence. Pakistan is a US ally, although its importance has diminished since Washington’s 2021 withdrawal from neighboring Afghanistan.\nEarlier Saturday, Pakistan launched counterattacks against India after three of its air bases were struck overnight. Indian Wing Commander Vyomika Singh told a briefing that there were “several high-speed missile attacks” on air bases, but “limited damage” to equipment.\nPakistan earlier accused India of targeting three of its bases with missiles — including one in Rawalpindi, some 10 kilometers (six miles) from the capital, Islamabad.\nAuthorities in Pakistan-administered Kashmir said 11 civilians were killed by Indian shelling overnight.",

    "date": "Updated 02:05 PM GMT+5:30, May 10, 2025",
    "article": "The mother of a hostage held by Hamas in Gaza issued an emotional appeal to US President Donald Trump, who is due in the region this week, not to “give up” on pushing Israel and the terror group toward a ceasefire.\nEinav Zangauker, the mother of hostage Matan Zangauker and one of the leaders of the movement calling for a hostage deal, made the comments ahead of the weekly mass protests calling for the hostages to be freed, to be held Saturday evening.\n“You can’t sweep this under the rug or sugarcoat it. The recent deals, the latest hostages who returned to us — it all happened solely thanks to [Trump],” Zangauker said in an interview with the Walla news site.\n“And I truly know that President Trump has a vision for the Middle East, that he’s not interested in wars, that he’s doing everything to reach agreements — whether it’s with Iran, or Russia and Ukraine — and here too, it matters to him to bring this to an end. But he doesn’t have a partner on our side,” said Zangauker, who has been a fierce critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the government.\nHer comments come as Trump is set to depart for Saudi Arabia on Monday before making stops in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. He is slated to return on Friday, May 16. He has said Israel will not be on the itinerary.\n“And if I could make just one distilled request: Don’t give up on us. Those who came back did so thanks to President Trump. And we need him to stay involved until the last hostage is brought home,” Zangauker said.\nעינב צנגאוקר בראיון ב @WallaNews – \"אם הייתי יכולה להגיד בקשה אחת מזוקקת לנשיא טראמפ. \"Don't give up on us\". מי שחזר חזר בזכות הנשיא טראמפ. ואנחנו חייבים שהוא יהיה מעורב עד שנחזיר את אחרון החטופים\" pic.twitter.com/TPL4PaTCFl\n— Tal Shalev (@talshalev1) May 10, 2025\nHowever, recent signs have indicated that Trump is losing patience with Israel and is increasingly at odds with Netanyahu.\nTrump expressed his frustration at his lack of impact recently in brokering a deal between Israel and Hamas, telling a group of top donors last week that finding a solution to the war in Gaza has been hard because “they’d been fighting for a thousand years,” the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.\nOn the campaign trail, the US president boasted that he could bring the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine to a quick end, but has yet to do so after over 100 days in office.\nOn Ukraine, Trump told the donors that the war kept him up at night, and that dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin was a challenge because he “wanted the whole thing,” referring to all of Ukraine.\nThousands of demonstrators are expected to congregate across Israel on Saturday night to protest against the government and call for a deal to release hostages held by the terror group Hamas, as uncertainty grows about the fate of the remaining captives.\nIn Tel Aviv, the weekly anti-government rally will start at 7:00 p.m. at Habima Square.\nThe demonstration will feature Rafi Ben Shitrit, the former Beit She’an mayor, whose son Alroy was killed on October 7, 2023. Ben Shitrit’s participation is notable because of his past affiliation with Netanyahu’s Likud and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar’s New Hope.\nProtest organizers said that after the rally ends, demonstrators will join demonstrations with hostage families at Hostages Square and Begin Road.\nIn Jerusalem, a demonstration will begin at 8:30 p.m. with a march from Zion Square to Paris Square, near the prime minister’s official residence.\nTerror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 59 hostages, including 58 of the 251 abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on October 7, 2023. They include the bodies of at least 35 confirmed dead by the Israel Defense Forces.\nIt is currently believed that 21 of the 59 hostages are alive. The status of three hostages — IDF soldier Tamir Nimordi, Bipin Joshi of Nepal, and Pinta Nattpong of Thailand —is considered highly questionable by Israeli officials because no signs of life have been received from them since the war broke out. No sign of life has been received either from Ariel Cunio, an Israeli civilian.\nAmid the resurgent worry over the hostages’ status, Haaretz revealed Wednesday that in a military document outlining plans for a new Gaza offensive, the IDF had ranked the return of the hostages as its least important objective.\nThe document, presented to commanders on Tuesday, placed the Hamas-held captives in sixth and last place, a fact incongruent with army officials’ previous assertions to the Israeli public that the return of the hostages was the IDF’s most important war goal.\nHamas released 30 hostages — 20 Israeli civilians, five soldiers, and five Thai nationals — and the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives during a ceasefire between January and March. The terror group freed 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November 2023, and four hostages were released before that in the early weeks of the war. In exchange, Israel has freed some 2,000 jailed Palestinian terrorists, security prisoners, and Gazan terror suspects detained during the war.\nEight hostages have been rescued from captivity by troops alive, and the bodies of 41 have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the Israeli military as they tried to escape their captors, and the body of a soldier who was killed in 2014.\nThe body of another soldier killed in 2014, Lt. Hadar Goldin, is still being held by Hamas and is counted among the 59 hostages.",

    "date": "Updated 12:38 PM GMT+5:30, May 10, 2025",
    "article": "Jonatan Urich, the senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, received payments from Qatar dating back to just after war broke out between Israel and the Hamas terror group on October 7, 2023, Hebrew media reported Friday, marking the latest development in the “Qatargate” affair.\nWhile Urich initially denied any involvement with the Qataris and said the investigation was politically motivated, he later admitted to assisting Qatar with matters related to the 2022 World Cup. Sources told Channel 12 news that the latest findings have rendered Urich the main suspect in the Qatargate investigation.\nAccording to Channel 13 news, the police possess documents, text messages, and bank data showing that Urich received payments from Doha after October 7, 2023, when Israel was determining whether to accept the Qataris as mediators in negotiations with Hamas. Payments that could be traced back to Qatar continued to be made to Urich throughout 2024, the Channel 13 report said.\nQatar has been a key mediator, along with Egypt and the US, in Gaza hostage-ceasefire negotiations. In recent years it also sent vast amounts of money, including hundreds of millions of dollars in cash delivered with the support of Netanyahu, into Gaza — funds that IDF and Shin Bet probes have said helped finance Hamas’s war machine and the terror group’s October 7, 2023, invasion and slaughter in southern Israel.\nPolice are reportedly trying to determine whether Urich indeed advanced Qatari interests and whether he received assistance from a second suspect, former Netanyahu aide Eli Feldstein, who has already been charged with leaking classified information in a separate case. Police are also investigating the possibility that Feldstein worked with Qatar independently of Urich.\nThe Qatargate affair has revolved primarily around suspicions that Urich and Feldstein committed multiple offenses tied to their alleged work for the pro-Qatar lobbying firm, including contact with a foreign agent and a series of corrupt actions involving lobbyists and businessmen, all while working for the prime minister.\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal against a decision to keep Urich in custody. Justice Yechiel Kasher stated in his ruling, “I am satisfied that there was no miscarriage of justice in the district court’s decision.”\nAt the session, Urich’s lawyers appeared to admit that their client had worked for Qatar, stating that charges against him were invalid since it is not officially an enemy state.\nIn their appeal, Urich’s lawyers claimed that the district court “made a mistake in defining the offense,” adding that Qatar isn’t defined by Israeli law as an enemy country and arguing that “many officials in Israel, including very senior defense officials,” regularly work with the Gulf nation.\nThey also argued that Urich, as a private individual providing services to the premier’s Likud party rather than a state-employed official, “is allowed to concurrently work in any role.”\nUrich had been brought in for questioning on Wednesday afternoon regarding new evidence the police wished to ask him about, and was arrested just after midnight.\nPolice sought to extend his detention by five days and extend Feldstein’s house arrest by 30 days, but a judge refused both requests and granted police 24 hours to file an appeal against his decision.\nThe judge also raised substantive questions over the investigation, pointing out that although Urich and Feldstein were working for the prime minister, they were not formally employed by the Prime Minister’s Office and were therefore not civil servants.\nOnly civil servants can be charged with crimes, such as bribery and breach of trust, which police wish to level against the two suspects.\nThe ongoing investigation continues to expand, and the Shin Bet and police are now probing the involvement and business connections of two former security officials with Qatar, Hebrew media outlets reported Thursday.\nAccording to Haaretz, the two former Mossad agents were recently questioned by the Shin Bet, and the police sought to question further suspects in connection with the affair.\nOne of the former security officials under investigation is a former Mossad official, referred to only as “Shin,” who worked in cooperation with Qatari intelligence during his time at the spy agency and today does business in Qatar, Channel 12 news reported.\nThe second suspect was said to be David Saig, an Israeli businessman, a former Mossad official and a close friend of Shin, who was Saig’s boss during their time in the Mossad.\nSaig himself has been questioned under caution as a suspect in the Qatargate investigation.\nAccording to Channel 12, Shin owns a company with retired IDF general Yoav Mordechai, who formed connections with the Qataris during his time as head of the Defense Ministry’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT).\nPolice suspect that Mordechai connected two of the central suspects in the Qatargate affair, Urich and former Likud election campaign manager Yisrael Einhorn, to the Qatari government when they did public relations work for Doha ahead of the 2022 World Cup.\nUrich and Einhorn are also suspected of having a business relationship with Shin and Saig, said Channel 12.\nThe report further said that Shin and Mordechai’s company has a relationship with a German company owned by Gil Birger, another Israeli businessman suspected of having transferred money from pro-Qatari lobbyist Jay Footlik to Feldstein.",

    "article": "ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan’s foreign minister said Saturday his country would consider de-escalation if India stopped further attacks. This came after India said it was committed to non-escalation if Pakistan reciprocated.\nBoth countries have traded strikes Saturday, the latest escalation in a conflict triggered by a massacre last month that India blames on Pakistan.\nIshaq Dar, the Pakistani foreign minister, still warned that if India launched any strikes, “our response will follow.”\nDar told Pakistan’s Geo News that he also conveyed this message to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he contacted him after speaking to New Delhi two hours ago.\n“We responded because our patience had reached its limit. If they stop here, we will also consider stopping,” he said.\nIndia said it targeted Pakistani military bases after Islamabad fired several high-speed missiles at multiple Indian air bases in the country’s Punjab state early Saturday.\nPakistan earlier said it intercepted most missiles targeting three air bases and that retaliatory strikes on India were underway.\nIndian Col. Sofiya Qureshi, at a news conference in New Delhi, said Pakistan also targeted health facilities and schools at its three air bases in Indian-controlled Kashmir. “Befitting reply has been given to Pakistani actions,” she said.\nWing Commander Vyomika Singh, who was also present at the news conference, said India was committed to “non-escalation” provided that Pakistan reciprocates. However, Pakistani ground forces were observed mobilizing towards forward areas, she said, “indicating an offensive intent to further escalate the situation.”\n“Indian armed forces remain in a high state of operational readiness,” she added.\nSingh said Indian armed forces carried out “precision strikes only at identified military targets in response to Pakistani actions,” which included technical infrastructure, command and control centres, radar sites and weapon storage areas to ensure “minimum collateral damage.”\nShe said Pakistan had overnight launched several high-speed missiles targeting multiple air bases and civilian infrastructure in the northern Indian state of Punjab.\n“All hostile actions have been effectively countered and responded to appropriately,” she said.\nThe Pakistani army’s actions were “provocation” and India’s response was “measured,” foreign secretary Vikram Misri said.\nMisri also rejected Pakistan military’s claims that it had destroyed several air force stations in India and caused serious damages to artillery depots, military establishments and critical infrastructure, including power stations.\nThe Pakistani military said it used medium-range Fateh missiles to target an Indian missile storage facility and airbases in the cities of Pathankot and Udhampur.\nThe Associated Press could not independently verify all the actions attributed to Pakistan or India.\nArmy spokesman, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif, said Pakistan’s air force assets were safe following the Indian strikes, adding that some of the Indian missiles also hit India’s eastern Punjab.\n“This is a provocation of the highest order,” Sharif said.\nRubio spoke to his Indian counterpart S. Jaishankar and emphasized that “both sides need to identify methods to de-escalate and re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement Saturday.\nRubio also proposed US support in facilitating “productive discussions to avert future disputes,” the statement added.\nState-run Pakistan Television reported that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has convened a meeting of the National Command Authority, the body responsible for overseeing the country’s missile program and other strategic assets.\nTensions between the nuclear-armed rivals have soared since an attack at a popular tourist site in India-controlled Kashmir left 26 civilians dead, mostly Hindu Indian tourists, on April 22. New Delhi has blamed Pakistan for backing the assault, an accusation Islamabad rejects.\nThe call for calm came ahead of Saturday’s Indian missile strikes, which targeted Nur Khan air base in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad, Murid air base in Chakwal city and Rafiqui air base in the Jhang district of eastern Punjab province, according to Pakistan’s military spokesman.\nThere was no media access to the air base in Rawalpindi, a densely populated city, and no immediate reports of residents hearing or seeing the strike or its aftermath.\nFollowing the announcement of Pakistani retaliation, residents in Indian-controlled Kashmir said they heard loud explosions at multiple places in the region, including the two big cities of Srinagar and Jammu, and the garrison town of Udhampur.\n“Explosions that we are hearing today are different from the ones we heard the last two nights during drone attacks,” said Shesh Paul Vaid, the region’s former top police official and Jammu resident. “It looks like a war here.”\nVaid said explosions were heard from areas with military bases, adding it appeared that army sites were being targeted.\nSrinagar appeared calm early Saturday, but some residents in neighborhoods close to the city’s airport, which is also an air base, said they were rattled by the explosions and booming sound of fighter jets.\n“I was already awake, but the explosions jolted my kids out of their sleep. They started crying,” said Srinagar resident Mohammed Yasin, adding he heard at least two explosions.\nPraveen Donthi, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group for India, said the two countries were at war even if they had not yet labelled it as one.\n“It’s become a remorseless race for military one-upmanship with no apparent strategic end goals from either side,” said Donthi. “With increasing civilian casualties on both sides, finding an exit or off-ramp is going to be challenging.”\nIndia’s army said it destroyed multiple armed Pakistani drones that were spotted flying over a military cantonment in northern Punjab state’s Amritsar city early Saturday.\n“Pakistan’s blatant attempt to violate India’s sovereignty and endanger civilians is unacceptable,” the statement said.\nIn Pakistan, the civil aviation authority shut the country’s airports for all flight operations and people in major cities were seen chanting slogans supporting the armed forces.\n“Thank God we have finally responded to Indian aggression,” said Muhammad Ashraf, who had headed out for breakfast in the eastern city of Lahore.\nIndia and Pakistan have traded strikes and heavy cross-border fire for days, resulting in civilian casualties on both sides.\nThe Group of Seven nations, or G7, urged “maximum restraint” from India and Pakistan. It warned Friday that further military escalation posed a serious threat to regional stability.",

    "headline": "Yeshiva University rescinds approval of LGBTQ+ student group",
    "subheading": "Orthodox university’s rabbis say ‘Hareni’ violated settlement agreement that allowed for its formation; students refuse to include ‘sexual morality’ disclaimer on club’s ads",
    "date": "Updated 10:37 AM GMT+5:30, May 10, 2025",
    "article": "JTA — Yeshiva University has revoked its recognition of a campus LGBTQ+ club just two months after approving it.\nThe Modern Orthodox flagship is alleging that the club, Hareni, breached the terms of the settlement agreement that allowed for its formation. Hareni’s lawyers claim that the school may be the one breaching the settlement and say statements by school leaders “threaten” LGBTQ students’ safety. The club has vowed to keep operating.\nYU’s decision to recognize Hareni in March — and settle related legal battles — marked a sharp pivot. For years, the school had fought in court to avoid recognition of the Pride Alliance, an LGBTQ support group that was unofficially launched in 2009 but never received formal recognition from the university’s administration.\nAt issue was Orthodox Judaism’s prohibition against homosexual relations. YU seeks to inculcate in its students the idea that they can live fully committed Orthodox Jewish lives while participating in modern society, and the question of welcoming LGBTQ students has strained that mission for years.\nBoth the school and the leaders of Hareni, who had previously led the Pride Alliance, depicted the March announcement as a resolution of the conflict. But within days of announcing recognition of the LGBTQ group, Yeshiva University president Rabbi Ari Berman said the values espoused by a typical “Pride” club are “antithetical” to the school. Rabbi Hershel Schachter, who leads YU’s rabbinical school, stated in March that he “emphatically rejects the ideology, lifestyle and behaviors which the LGBTQ term represents.”\nThis week, the conflict appeared to heat up again. Lawyers for the school and the club had exchanged dueling letters, and the decision to officially disband Hareni was announced Friday in an email to students from the dean of undergraduate Torah studies, Rabbi Yosef Kalinsky.\nIn the email, Kalinsky echoed Berman’s previous language, saying a pride club is “antithetical to the Torah values” of the university.\n“There is no place for such a club in yeshiva,” the email said. “As such, we are directing the Office of Student Life to discontinue this club.”\nThe decision to disband was made the day after a law firm representing Hareni sent a letter to the university expressing “deep concern about recent public statements by Yeshiva University’s senior leaders that display animus and hostility toward the University’s LGBTQ students,” according to the YU Observer, a Yeshiva University student newspaper. The letter accused the school of potentially violating its March settlement.\nThe letter claimed such statements “threaten the safety and well-being of LGBTQ students on campus.” The letter also cites an April 10 letter sent to YU alumni saying that the university required Hareni to include a “‘sexual morality’ disclaimer on all of its materials, communications, and publications.”\nYU says the club ran counter to the school’s outlook in word and deed.\nIn a written statement to the New York Jewish Week, the school alleged, “since the moment the club was announced, Hareni members, their legal counsel and public relations firm, have continuously made false and misleading statements that have sowed confusion regarding religious beliefs, and that are contrary to the goals that the approved guidelines set out for Hareni.”\nIn addition, YU’s lawyers sent a letter to Hareni’s lawyers claiming the club “violated” university rules, including posting Pride flags on its Instagram account, organizing social events and using YU’s name when hosting off-campus, unofficial events.\nThe school’s lawyers said the club “failed to include in their advertisements the notice that the Roshei Yeshiva required any time the Hareni name was used—i.e., referring to helping ‘students who seek to fully maintain traditional halachic standards of sexual morality …’”\nThe co-presidents of Hareni, Hayley Goldberg and Schneur Friedman, co-wrote an op-ed in the YU Observer on Tuesday, explaining the aims of the club. They added, “What we will not be doing as a club is writing the egregious statement, ‘This club is for students who seek to fully maintain traditional halachic standards of sexual morality as defined by the Shulchan Aruch’ on our posters and communications.” The Shulchan Aruch is a widely followed code of Jewish law.\n“Equating an identity with sexual immorality looks past us as a people,” wrote Goldberg and Friedman, who did not respond to a request for comment. “This statement sexualizes students and forgets every other aspect of them as a person. It reduces complex individuals to a single dimension, stripping them of their intellect, character, contributions to our community, and their spiritual journey.”\nIn a statement Friday, Hareni reiterated that the club has always operated “in accordance with the guidelines agreed upon and with deep respect for Halacha,” or Jewish law.\n”We remain committed to that path,” the statement said. “No attempt to silence or erase our existence will change that. If OSL [the Office of Student Life] responds to the call to ‘discontinue’ us, we will continue as though we were not. We will continue to hold events and safe spaces – albeit in an ‘unofficial’ manner.”\nRachael Fried, a YU alum and executive director of Jewish Queer Youth, a nonprofit that has provided support to LGBTQ Jews at YU, lamented the approach the school’s leadership has taken toward the students.\n“I’m incredibly proud of the students and their resilience that has brought us to where we are today, that we’re even having these conversations out loud,” she said.\n“It’s really disappointing to me that the leaders of Modern Orthodoxy feel so strongly to speak out against their very vulnerable and at-risk students in this way,” she added. “This notion that Pride and halacha, or Jewish law or Torah, are mutually exclusive is just not true.”",
