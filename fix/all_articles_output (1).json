    "article": "Hostage negotiations kicked off in Doha on Wednesday with renewed energy and optimism from US mediators following Hamas’s release of American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, but an Israeli and an Arab official told The Times of Israel that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s refusal to accept proposals that commit Jerusalem to permanently ending the war in Gaza significantly limit chances for success.\nStill, US special envoy to the Mideast Steve Witkoff is leaning hard on both Israel and Hamas to compromise and will stick with it through at least the Friday conclusion of US President Donald Trump’s Mideast trip, the Israeli official said, adding that the negotiations may be allowed extend further if they remain substantive, but need a little more time.\nFor its part, Israel has pledged to launch a new massive military operation to reoccupy and hold onto the entire Strip indefinitely if Hamas does not agree to what it has called the “Witkoff proposal” by the end of Trump’s trip. This proposal envisions the release of as many as half of the remaining living hostages in exchange for a weekslong ceasefire during which Israel would agree to hold talks regarding the terms of an end to the war, without committing up front to such a result.\nHamas has pushed back on this framework, insisting on guarantees that the war will end before it releases additional hostages. It has pointed to Israel’s refusal to hold talks on a permanent ceasefire earlier this year, even though it had agreed to do so as part of the ceasefire inked in January, which collapsed after its first stage in March.\nThe terror group has proposed releasing all of the hostages at once in exchange for an end to the war, but Netanyahu has rejected this trade, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power. Successive polls have indicated, though, that the premier is out of step with the majority of Israelis who back such a framework. But Netanyahu is also facing pressure from his far-right coalition partners who have threatened to collapse the government if he were to end the war in exchange for the remaining 58 hostages — between 20 and 23 of whom are believed to still be alive.\nWhile Netanyahu has stuck to the “Witkoff proposal” from earlier this year, the Israeli official said the US envoy has moved away from this proposal and is instead pushing frameworks that more definitively include a permanent end to the war, while removing Hamas from power in Gaza.\nWitkoff held a phone call with Netanyahu for over two hours on Wednesday during which the US envoy sought to push Netanyahu toward his new framework, but did not make significant progress, the Israeli official said.\nThe Arab official said Hamas has indicated willingness to show flexibility on the issue of disarmament if Israel agrees to end the war and withdraw its forces from Gaza. The terror group has already said it was prepared to transfer governing power to an independent committee of Palestinian technocrats.\nEgyptian and Qatari mediators have also been pushing Hamas to accept an initial ceasefire of several months — longer than the 45-day ceasefire that Netanyahu has said it is prepared to accept — that includes assurances from the mediators that they will ensure Israel remains at the negotiating table during that time to hash out the terms of a permanent end to the war and doesn’t resume fighting in the meantime, the Arab official said.\nQatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari appeared to confirm this effort, telling the local Al Araby Al Jadeed newspaper that the mediators’ current goal is to reach an initial ceasefire that is longer than the truce from earlier this year, which lasted six weeks, and provides an opportunity for the parties to reach additional agreements.\n“There are still challenges, but President Trump’s visit has given momentum to the negotiations,” al-Ansari said.\nAl-Ansari said that the new talks in Doha revolve around a US-backed proposal for an extended truce, the release of the remaining hostages and talks about the future of the Gaza Strip.\nLater Wednesday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told CNN that Israel’s sustained airstrikes this week send the signal that it is not interested in negotiating a ceasefire\nAmong the various meetings held in Qatar on Wednesday was a sit-down between Witkoff and senior Qatari negotiators, in the presence of several hostage families. The meeting was said by Al Jazeera to have lasted for some two-and-a-half hours.\nWitkoff was in the Gulf state along with Trump, who made Qatar the second stop on a three-country tour that started in Saudi Arabia on Monday and will end in the United Arab Emirates on Friday.\nMeanwhile, an American source denied an Arabic media report that Witkoff had met directly with senior Hamas officials.\nWhile no major breakthroughs were made by late Wednesday night, the Israeli and Arab officials said they expect US pressure to intensify over the next 48 hours.\nAn Israeli negotiating team made up of the former Shin Bet deputy chief, Netanyahu’s diplomatic adviser Ophir Falk and the government’s hostage point-man Gal Hirsch remains in Doha for continued discussions, though, the Israeli official said their mandate is very limited. Witkoff understood this when he chose to pick up the phone and speak directly with Netanyahu on Wednesday, the official added.\nDuring a meeting Witkoff held with hostage families on Tuesday in Tel Aviv, one of the participants was recorded asking the US envoy why the US wasn’t pressuring Netanyahu to end the war. Witkoff could be heard responding that Israel is a sovereign country and that Washington wouldn’t force Jerusalem to make such a decision.\nChannel 12 quoted a senior Israeli official familiar with the hostage talks as having said that “the Americans have an attitude of ‘take it or leave it,’ or we’re gone. They are determined that whoever doesn’t go with them will lose a lot.”\nIsrael is also hoping that it will soon know the results of its Tuesday strike targeting Hamas’s Gaza leader Muhammad Sinwar, who it has viewed as an obstacle to the kinds of deals it has hoped to reach, the Israeli official said, expressing hope that his elimination would swing the power balance toward Hamas’s leadership abroad.\nIf Sinwar’s death is confirmed, the mediators are hoping that Israel will agree to put off its military operation in order to give time for Hamas to regroup and determine its decision-making framework, the Arab official said.\nNurit Yohanan contributed to this report.",

    "article": "US special envoy Steve Witkoff and US hostage envoy Adam Boehler on Tuesday told families of hostages still in Gaza that they think there is a chance to make progress on freeing their loved ones as they head to Qatar for indirect talks between Israel and Hamas, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum said.\nThe Forum said that during a two-hour meeting, Witkoff “expressed that everyone would prefer to see a diplomatic solution, noting that most captivity survivors have been released through diplomatic means.”\n“He assured the families that if he and Boehler didn’t believe there was a genuine chance for progress in negotiations, they wouldn’t be making the trip to Doha,” the Forum added.\nWitkoff also insisted that Trump would be “relentless” in working to ensure that all remaining hostages come home, the Forum said.\nIn further remarks at the meeting broadcast on Tuesday evening on Channel 12 news, Witkoff said: “Everything is moving in the direction of: create a deal to diplomatically solve it. And if we can’t diplomatically solve it… it will be one of the worst failures that I can ever endure in my life.”\nתיעוד בלעדי מתוך דברי ויטקוף למשפחות החטופים: \"חמאס התייחס לעידן טוב יותר מאז בחירת טראמפ\" | @SuleimanMas1 עם המסר המעודד#מהדורתכאןחדשות pic.twitter.com/X7RUOFyHdH\n— כאן חדשות (@kann_news) May 13, 2025\nAt another point in the discussion, the father of hostage Nimrod Cohen posed a question to Witkoff: “Why aren’t you forcing the Israeli government to stop the war? Because this is the only way it could end. For the good of everybody,” he asked in a recording obtained by Haaretz.\n“I don’t want to get into it,” Witkoff responded. “We’re not the Israeli government. We don’t disagree. The Israeli government is a sovereign government. They can’t tell us what to do, and we can’t tell them what to do.”\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to end the war in exchange for all of the hostages, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power. He appears to be out of step with the majority of Israelis who back such an exchange, according to repeated polls.\nThe meeting between Witkoff and hostage families came ahead of another round of negotiations in Doha that was slated to start on Wednesday. Netanyahu said Israel may agree to a short-term truce, but will not end the war in Gaza until Hamas is defeated, his office said Tuesday.\n“Eliminating Hamas and freeing all our hostages — these go hand in hand. That’s how we’re doing this,” Netanyahu said Monday night in a meeting with injured reservists from the group “Wounded Soldiers for Victory,” according to a video shared by his office. The premier also told the soldiers that Israel was gearing up to take control of the Strip and was looking for countries to take in Gazans.\nThe premier has stressed that negotiations would be conducted with Gaza “under fire” — despite a reported US commitment to the contrary — and that the military’s planned offensive to achieve control of the entire Strip will still go ahead if Hamas does not release more captives first.\nThe negotiations were jump-started by the release on Monday of US-Israeli captive soldier Edan Alexander following indirect talks between Witkoff and Hamas, in which the White House reportedly agreed to the terror group’s request that the US pressure Israel into a ceasefire-hostage deal.\nHamas on Tuesday said Netanyahu was “misleading” the public by calling Alexander’s release the result of Israeli military pressure. The terror group said the release was “the result of serious communications with the US administration and the efforts of mediators.”\nAlexander’s release was widely seen as a goodwill gesture to US President Donald Trump, who is due in Doha on Wednesday as part of a state visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The soldier was the last known living US citizen in Hamas captivity, and his release was seen as a goodwill gesture to Trump.\nIn the wake of Alexander’s release, terror groups in the Gaza Strip are holding 58 hostages, including 57 of those abducted on October 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists stormed southern Israel to kill some 1,200 people and take 251 hostages, sparking the war in Gaza.\nAlexander and 23 other young men still thought to be alive had been set for release in the second phase of a ceasefire-hostage deal that was struck in January following mediation by Egypt, the US and Qatar. However, the deal’s 42-day first phase expired on March 2 amid Netanyahu’s refusal to negotiate the second phase, which would have required a full IDF withdrawal from Gaza — a red line for his far-right coalition partners.\nNetanyahu at the time demanded Hamas agree to “Witkoff’s framework,” which would have extended the first phase of the ceasefire by some 40 days in return for about half the remaining living hostages. On Monday, as negotiations were set to resume, the premier reportedly told coalition partners that Israel was still committed to the framework, saying the war would continue until Hamas is vanquished.\nWitkoff and Boehler, who on Tuesday visited Alexander at Tel Aviv’s Ichilov Hospital, later told members of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum that Trump remained committed to bringing home all the remaining captives.\n“The president’s not going to tolerate anything other than everybody coming home, and he will be relentless on that pursuit… when people don’t do so well with the United States, we don’t do so well with them,” said Witkoff at the Forum’s Tel Aviv headquarters, according to video released by the group.\nWitkoff and Boehler tell hostages famalies: The president will not accept anything less than the return of all the hostages. pic.twitter.com/O4XwvTC0nT\n— Amichai Stein (@AmichaiStein1) May 13, 2025\nAccording to Channel 12 news, a “small” delegation of hostages’ relatives was also headed to Doha and would meet with both Trump and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman al-Thani. The report did not specify the exact makeup of the delegation, but said the group would be led by Eytan Stibbe, a former fighter pilot, arms dealer and businessman who was part of a private trip to space in 2022.\nAl-Thani, whose country backs Hamas and hosts its politburo, suggested to Trump and Witkoff during a visit to Washington last month that they accept a Hamas-approved proposal to release all the hostages and end the war in Gaza, but was told Washington would accept only a temporary, phased deal, Axios reported Tuesday.\nUpon returning to Doha, al-Thani encouraged Hamas to make a gesture to Trump to change the US president’s position, according to the report. Shortly afterward, Hamas reached out to Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian-American businessman and Trump supporter, to mediate talks with the US on the proposal, the report said, citing four Israeli, Palestinian and US officials. The existence of this backchannel was first reported by The Times of Israel.\nThe White House subsequently told the terror group that if Alexander were released, the US would pressure Israel to implement a 70- to 90-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of 10 hostages, during which negotiations for a final deal would be held, according to a Palestinian official cited by in the report.\nThe US, Qatar and Egypt would ensure that the war wouldn’t resume throughout the talks, the official added, though the US did not confirm this to Axios.\nFor his part, Trump did not pressure Netanyahu during their phone call Monday to roll back his plans for an expanded ground campaign in Gaza set to begin after Trump’s Middle East visit, Israeli officials told Axios.\nSpeaking to the wounded reservists Monday night, Netanyahu said “the situation has changed,” and vowed that “in the coming days, we’ll go in with full force to complete the operation.”\n“Completing the operation means subduing Hamas. It means destroying Hamas,” he said.\n“Maybe Hamas will say, ‘Wait — we want to release ten more,’” added Netanyahu. “Fine, bring them. We’ll take them. And then we’ll go in. But there will be no situation where we stop the war.”\n“A temporary ceasefire — fine. But we’re going all the way,” he said.\nNetanyahu also said Israel was gearing up to let Gazans emigrate, in keeping with a plan announced by Trump in February to take over the devastated Strip, oust its residents and rebuild it as a coastal resort.\n“We’ve already set up a governing body that will allow [civilians] to exit, but the main issue is this — we need host countries willing to absorb them,” said Netanyahu. “That’s what we’re working on right now.”\n“If we give them a way out, I’m telling you — more than 50% will leave. In my opinion, many more,” he said, assuring the soldiers that, in any case, “Hamas will not remain.”\nThe premier said the “Wounded Soldiers for Victory” reservists, who oppose a ceasefire in Gaza, are “an inspiration, and with your spirit, we are heading toward a total victory.” The reservists, meanwhile, “expressed support for Netanyahu’s leadership in pursuing victory and achieving all the war’s objectives, and urged him to decisively defeat the terrorist organization Hamas,” the premier’s office said.\nAFP contributed to this report.",

    "article": "Sixty-one percent of Israelis support normalizing ties with Saudi Arabia and expanding the Abraham Accords in 2025, according to a poll published Tuesday, coinciding with US President Donald Trump’s first Middle East tour.\nThe survey, conducted by Ipanel on behalf of the Coalition for Regional Security, found that just 4.7% of respondents opposed Saudi normalization, while 33.9% said they neither support nor oppose such a move.\nThe survey measured Israeli public attitudes on regional diplomacy, the war in Gaza, and a potential US-led initiative based on a representative sample of 954 Israeli adults, including both Jews and Arabs.\nThe poll was released as Trump began a four-day trip to the Middle East, kicking off in Saudi Arabia before continuing to the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Speaking at an investment summit in Riyadh, the president said Tuesday that it is his “dream” for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, though he acknowledged that Riyadh would do so in its own time.\n“It’s my fervent hope, wish and even my dream that Saudi Arabia… will soon be joining the Abraham Accords,” he said.\nThe poll suggests that many Israelis share that sentiment. When asked whether normalization with Saudi Arabia would strengthen Israel’s security, economy and regional standing, and weaken Iran, 67% of respondents said it would contribute significantly. Another 16% said it would contribute little or not at all, while 17.1% said they didn’t know.\nSupport for normalization was also consistent across political lines. Among Israelis who voted for the parties in the government coalition, 60% said they support normalization (compared to 61% of all respondents), and 65% said it would contribute significantly to Israel’s strategic interests (compared to 67% overall).\nThe poll also addressed the impact of Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza on ties with Saudi Arabia and beyond. A majority — 53% — said that occupying and controlling the Gaza Strip would somewhat or greatly harm the chances of reaching an agreement with Saudi Arabia and cooperating with moderate countries in the region. Just 12.8% said it would not harm those efforts, while 34.3% said it would neither help nor hinder them.\nA substantial majority — 68.9% — said they would back a Trump-led regional political initiative that included the return of all Israeli hostages, an end to the war in Gaza, normalization with Saudi Arabia, a pathway toward separation from the Palestinians, and the formation of a US-led regional security coalition against Iran. Only 9.7% said no, while 21.5% were neutral.\nUpon publication of the poll, the Coalition for Regional Security — a group of over 100 senior Israeli figures from the military, political, business, and academic sectors — called on the government to act quickly.\n“This survey serves as an urgent wake-up call to the Israeli government: enough with political intransigence — get on board the regional train now,” the group said in a statement.\n“This is the moment to seize the historic opportunity presented by President Trump to reshape the Middle East and strengthen Israel’s security. History will not forgive those who miss the chance to bring regional stability through strategic alliances and courageous partnerships that are forming at this very moment. The Israeli people want this — now the government must say ‘yes’ to President Trump. If we keep hesitating — we will be left behind.”\nDuring his visit in Riyadh, Trump signed a host of economic and bilateral cooperation agreements with Saudi Arabia.\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto Saudi ruler, has already committed to some $600 billion in new Saudi investment in the US, but Trump teased that $1 trillion would be even better. The agreements included a mammoth arms deal described by the White House as the largest “in history” between the allies, worth nearly $142 billion.\nTrump also announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria’s new government, after being pressed by bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nThe US president will next travel to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in his first Middle East tour, notably skipping Israel.",

    "date": "Updated 08:19 AM GMT+5:30, May 13, 2025",
    "article": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a call with coalition party chiefs on Monday, reportedly trying to assure them that Israel wasn’t going to agree to end the war before Hamas is defeated after he agreed to a request from the Trump administration to send a negotiating team to Doha in order to jumpstart long-stalled hostage negotiations with the terror group.\nNetanyahu agreed to the US request after meeting with US special envoy to the Mideast Steve Witkoff and holding a brief phone call with President Donald Trump after Hamas released American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander from 584 days in captivity. Hamas released Alexander in what has been characterized as a gesture of goodwill to Trump after the group received assurances from a third-party mediator that the step would go a long way with Washington, opening the door to the administration potentially coaxing Israel to end the war in Gaza.\nBut Netanyahu told coalition partners that he won’t budge from his refusal to end the war before Hamas’s military and governing capabilities have been completely dismantled, according to multiple Hebrew media reports.\nThis could put him at odds with not just Hamas, but also the United States, whose officials for the first time in months are employing rhetoric about “ending the war” in Gaza, as Israel threatens to massively expand its military operations in order to re-occupy the entire Strip.\nTrump characterized Hamas’s decision to release Alexander as a “step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators… to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.”\nHis ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee expressed the administration’s hope that Alexander’s release “marks the beginning of the end to this terrible war,” which was sparked over 19 months ago by Hamas when its terrorists invaded Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 253 hostage. Fifty-eight people are still being held in Gaza — at least 23 of whom are believed to be alive.\nOver 52,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the Gaza war, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures have not been credibly verified and don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants. On March 2, Israel began blocking humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, arguing that enough had gone in during a six-week ceasefire and asserting that Hamas has been stealing that assistance from civilians. But even IDF officials have acknowledged privately in recent weeks that the Strip is on the brink of starvation, and an Israeli plan to resume assistance faces mounting obstacles.\nWhile repeated polls have indicated that a clear majority of Israelis back ending the war in exchange for the hostages, Netanyahu has rejected this trade, arguing that it would leave Hamas in power. His far-right coalition partners have also threatened to collapse his government if he were to approve such an agreement.\nAll of this raises the stakes as an Israeli delegation takes off for Doha on Tuesday for another round of indirect talks with Hamas co-mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the US. The Israeli officials Netanyahu is sending to Doha are his diplomatic adviser Ophir Falk, the government’s hostage point man Gal Hirsch and a former Shin Bet deputy chief — whose name is barred from publication.\nTrump will also arrive in the region on Tuesday, starting in Saudi Arabia before continuing to Qatar and then the United Arab Emirates — with the Gaza war likely to come up during his meetings with Gulf leaders, even if the issue is not expected to dominate a trip largely focusing on US economic interests in the region.\nIsrael has threatened to launch its major military operation in Gaza once Trump leaves the Mideast on Friday if Hamas doesn’t agree to a hostage deal by then.\nNetanyahu told his coalition partners in his call on Monday that despite sending a negotiating team to Doha, his position hasn’t changed. The negotiators only have a mandate to discuss what the premier has referred to as the “Witkoff proposal,” which would see as many as half of the hostages released in exchange for a weekslong ceasefire. During that truce, Israel is prepared to hold talks regarding a permanent end to the war, but will accept nothing less than Hamas agreeing to disarm and give up governing control of Gaza.\nHamas has said it is prepared to cede control of the Strip and agree to a yearslong truce with Israel that includes security guarantees. However, it has long refused demands that it permanently disarm.\nIt has also demanded guarantees from the mediators — potentially in the form of a binding UN Security Council resolution — that Israel be prevented from resuming the war if Hamas agrees to release hostages. Arab mediators say they face an uphill battle convincing Hamas to release hostages without assurances that Israel will end the war because the previous deal signed in January was supposed to see the sides enter talks regarding the terms of a permanent ceasefire, but Netanyahu largely refused to do so and the truce collapsed in March after its first of three phases.\nNetanyahu, in his Monday call with coalition heads, said Israel would not accept any guarantees that it end the war absent the complete dismantlement of Hamas.\nThe US has backed this goal in the past, and Arab stakeholders are principally supportive, but they have argued that it will be a gradual process that requires Israel allowing for a viable alternative to be stood up in Gaza, with the foundation being a reformed Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu has refused to grant the PA a significant foothold in Gaza. The stance has stopped nearly half a dozen Arab countries from taking part in the post-war management of the Strip, given that they’ve conditioned their support on the establishment of a political horizon for an eventual two-state solution.\nAmid the lack of alternatives to Hamas, the war in Gaza has dragged on, as Hamas has managed to continue recruiting fighters, frequently returning to areas briefly cleared by the IDF. After asserting during the war’s initial months that Israel did not seek to re-occupy Gaza, such a result is seen as increasingly likely, and Netanyahu and his coalition partners are now openly framing it as their goal.\nIn a meeting with wounded IDF soldiers on Monday evening, Netanyahu said that “within days, things are going to happen in Gaza… that you have never seen before until now,” according to Hebrew media reports.\nThe meeting was held with the hawkish forum “Wounded Soldiers for Victory,” which was established about two weeks ago with the aim of promoting the “destruction of Hamas,” according to a Ynet report.\nIn the hour-and-a-half-long meeting, Netanyahu listened to the soldiers’ accounts of their combat injuries and said to them that, while he is “giving a chance” for the return of the hostages, if these efforts do not succeed, the fighting will be intense and “to the end,” says Ynet.\nNetanyahu was also quoted as having said that Israel will “occupy” Gaza and will take over security control over Gaza “forever.”\nLast week, Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel claimed on CNN that those calling for Israel to occupy Gaza are part of a fringe and don’t represent the position of the Israeli government.\nDuring closed-door testimony before the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Tuesday, Netanyahu said that Israel is “destroying more and more houses [in Gaza and Palestinians accordingly] have nowhere to return,” according to quotes leaked to the Maariv daily.\n“The only obvious result will be Gazans choosing to emigrate outside of the Strip,” Netanyahu continued. “But our main problem is finding countries to take them in.”\nNetanyahu told the lawmakers that he had recently discussed Trump’s plan for the US to take over Gaza with the president but acknowledged that there have been difficulties in implementing it.\nWhile Trump initially called on Egypt and Jordan to take in Palestinians, both countries quickly pushed back against the idea, insisting that Palestinians should be allowed to remain on their land.\nIsrael has also refrained from publicly assuring Gazans that those who leave will be allowed to return, further reducing the incentive for countries to take in Gazans, given the perception that they’d be interfering in a decades-old land conflict.\nDozens who have left Gaza as part of a pilot program offering them work abroad were reportedly required to sign documents upon departure acknowledging that there is no timeline for when they can come back due to the security situation. Children who have been evacuated for medical treatment abroad have also been prevented by Israel from reuniting with their families back in Gaza after the completion of their hospital stay.\nDuring Sunday’s Knesset committee meeting, Netanyahu claimed that despite the lack of success in finding countries to take in Gazans, the US is still interested in taking over Gaza.\nSources familiar with the matter have told The Times of Israel, however, that the Trump administration has put minimal effort into actually advancing Trump’s Gaza takeover plan, following the massive pushback it received from Arab allies since it was announced in early February.\nStill, Netanyahu told the lawmakers. “I know I will disappoint some people here, but we are not talking about Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip right now.”\nMK Limor Son Har-Melech replied, “Bring the Jews of the United States (to settle Gaza). That way, we can kill two birds with one stone,” according to Maariv.\nNetanyahu also briefed the committee on Israel’s plan to soon resume the distribution of aid in Gaza through a new system that aims to prevent assistance from being diverted by Hamas.\nNetanyahu said that those who pick up aid from newly established distribution hubs in southern Gaza will be barred from returning to places in Gaza outside of the new humanitarian zone being set up in southern Gaza. Israel’s aid plan envisions squeezing Gaza’s entire population of 2 million people into an area in and surrounding Rafah that makes up between 10 and 25 percent of the Strip. Those entering will be vetted by the IDF, according to officials briefed on the plan.\nA new organization called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation was established in order to manage the new aid program. GHF was supposed to announce its rollout last week, but has faced major setbacks after the UAE, the UN and other international bodies refused to cooperate or fund the initiative due to concerns that it doesn’t adequately address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where aid has been banned by Israel since March 2.",

    "article": "While Donald Trump is skipping a visit to Israel during his ongoing Mideast travels, the ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza has been a significant part of discussions, as the US president dismissed claims that the Jewish state is being sidelined by his trip.\n“This is good for Israel,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, in response to a question about skipping a stop in Israel. “Having a relationship like I have with these countries… I think it’s very good for Israel.”\nThe US president added that the White House might deserve “the most credit” for the release on Monday from Gaza of Israeli-US hostage Edan Alexander, and said if it weren’t for the US, “probably none of the hostages would be living right now.”\nAsked aboard the flight whether Israel deserves any credit for the release of  Alexander, Trump said: “Well, they’ve been fighting a long time, they’re warring, and I think they deserve a lot of credit.\n“I think my people deserve a lot of credit. Maybe the most credit,” he added. “Look, [Alexander] wouldn’t be there. If it weren’t for us, he wouldn’t be living right now. Probably none of the hostages would be living right now. We probably have 20 that are living, that we’ll be getting out step by step.”\nAlexander was released Monday from Gaza in what was described as a goodwill gesture from the Palestinian terror group Hamas to Trump ahead of the US president’s visit to the region.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Wednesday afternoon that the premier held a series of lengthy discussions with Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and the Israeli hostage negotiating team, which Witkoff has joined in Doha.\nWitkoff, who headed from Tel Aviv to Doha on Tuesday, arriving shortly before Trump landed there, met with senior Qatari officials in the presence of families of hostages being held in Gaza, according to Al Jazeera, which said the meeting lasted two and a half hours.\nNetanyahu agreed to send a delegation to Doha after speaking with Trump on Monday and meeting with Witkoff and US Ambassador Mike Huckabee, stressing at the time that “the negotiations will take place only under fire.”\nSpeaking in Riyadh earlier Wednesday, Trump told Gulf leaders that he hopes for the “future of safety and dignity of the Palestinian people” in Gaza, but that it cannot happen under Hamas, who “delight in raping, torturing and murdering innocent people.”\nAttending a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council in the Saudi capital, Trump said he “greatly appreciates” the role of the Gulf countries in trying to “bring this terrible conflict to an end, including securing the release of American hostage Edan Alexander.”\n“We thought Edan was dead,” he said, adding that “ultimately, all hostages of all nationalities must be released as a stepping stone to peace.”\n“We thought Edan was dead.”\nUS President Donald Trump says Hamas cannot pursue peace while delighting in terror, as he thanks Gulf leaders for helping secure the release of American hostage Edan Alexander.#US #Gaza #Palestine #SaudiArabia #GCC pic.twitter.com/rhqbRUmcYb\n— Al Arabiya English (@AlArabiya_Eng) May 14, 2025\nSpeaking to journalists after the Gulf summit, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud declared that the US and Saudi Arabia “agree to end the war in Gaza and release all hostages.”\nHe said the US administration is willing to make “very courageous decisions” to push toward a ceasefire in Gaza, and “open up pathways to resolving the broader issues of Palestine,” including “moving toward, one hopes, a Palestinian state,” according to a New York Times report.\nThe US did not issue a similar statement regarding any agreements reached with the Saudis about the war in Gaza.\nAl-Saud also said: “We need to reach a ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible,” adding that “without a ceasefire in Gaza, it would be difficult to supply aid” to the enclave.\nTurkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a relentless critic of Israel, who joined Trump’s talks with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa via video, thanked Trump in a speech for “promising me that he will act to end the worsening humanitarian disaster in Gaza.”\nIsrael has threatened to launch its major military operation in Gaza once Trump leaves the Mideast on Friday if Hamas doesn’t agree to a hostage deal by then.\nNetanyahu told his coalition partners on Monday that despite sending a negotiating team to Doha, his position hasn’t changed. The negotiators only have a mandate to discuss what the premier has referred to as the “Witkoff proposal,” which would see as many as half of the hostages released in exchange for a weekslong ceasefire. During that truce, Israel is prepared to hold talks regarding a permanent end to the war, but will accept nothing less than Hamas agreeing to disarm and give up governing control of Gaza.\nHamas has said it is prepared to cede control of the Strip and agree to a yearslong truce with Israel that includes security guarantees. However, it has long refused demands that it permanently disarm.\nIt has also demanded guarantees from the mediators — potentially in the form of a binding UN Security Council resolution — that Israel be prevented from resuming the war if Hamas agrees to release hostages. Arab mediators say they face an uphill battle convincing Hamas to release hostages without assurances that Israel will end the war because the previous deal signed in January was supposed to see the sides enter talks regarding the terms of a permanent ceasefire, but Netanyahu largely refused to do so and the truce collapsed in March after its first of three phases.\nNurit Yohanan, Jacob Magid and Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.",

    "date": "Updated 05:14 PM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "An earlier version of this Editor’s Note was sent out Wednesday in ToI’s weekly update email to members of the Times of Israel Community. To receive these Editor’s Notes as they’re released, join the ToI Community here.\nNobody had doubted US Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff’s immense personal commitment to securing the release of all the hostages from Hamas captivity in Gaza.\nBut he has proved it multiple times in the past few days. He oversaw the indirect contacts with Hamas that secured the release of the last living hostage with American citizenship, 21-year-old IDF soldier Edan Alexander. He flew to Israel to greet Alexander on his release on Monday, went to visit him and his family in the hospital on Tuesday, and put him on the phone with US President Donald Trump in Riyadh and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nExtraordinarily, he gave Alexander the Star of David necklace that his own son Andrew used to wear before his tragic death in 2011 and that he has reportedly worn himself ever since, and told the freed hostage that he “would be doing a great honor to my son if you keep wearing this.”\nHe and Trump’s hostages envoy Adam Boehler then spent over an hour and a half meeting with families of the remaining 58 hostages still held by Hamas, reiterating the Trump administration’s commitment to getting them all freed. Relative after relative emerged from the meeting with a little of their 586 days of agony eased. “It was a calming meeting,” Meirav Gilboa-Dalal, whose son Guy is among the living hostages, said on Wednesday morning. “We met a man who understands our pain.”\nIn an audio clip from the meeting, Witkoff can be heard saying that if he cannot facilitate a diplomatic solution to the hostage crisis, “it will be one of the worst failures that I can ever endure in my life.”\nWitkoff is in Doha right now attempting to arrange precisely such a solution, on behalf of a president who keeps restating that the US is determined to secure the release of all the hostages. Netanyahu has dispatched a delegation, too, but reportedly with little room for maneuver in negotiations. The prime minister said on Tuesday that were Hamas to offer “to release 10 more” living hostages, that would be “fine. We’ll take them… But there will be no situation where we stop the war.\n“A temporary ceasefire — fine. But we’re going all the way,” he stressed. “In the coming days, we’ll go in with full force to complete the operation. Completing the operation means subduing Hamas. It means destroying Hamas.”\nWitkoff on Tuesday hailed Netanyahu’s crucial role in the process that enabled Alexander’s release, assuring the prime minister in a phone conversation that the way he “allowed the negotiations to operate” was “in large part the reason that Edan is home with his family today.” And while Trump has been saying he is working to get the Gaza war ended “as quickly as possible,” he has reportedly not been directly pressing Netanyahu to do so in order to secure the freedom of the remaining hostages — a Hamas condition that Netanyahu has repeatedly made clear he will not accept, because it would mean Hamas surviving, rebuilding, and preparing to attack again.\nBut the US president, as he is proving almost minute by minute in his current fast-paced Middle East trip, is an insistent deal-maker. And whether he’s still broadly empathetic to Netanyahu’s concerns or not particularly bothered by some of them, he’s moving ahead on a whole range of vital regional issues without including Israel on his regional itinerary, without arranging for an Israeli presence at his critical meetings, and without heeding Israeli concerns in an expanding number of his agreements.\nBefore setting out on his trip, Trump signed a truce with the Houthis two days after they launched a missile that struck Ben Gurion Airport, prompting foreign airlines to flee.\nHe dramatically deepened US-Saudi relations, with Israel out of the loop — telling Saudi leaders on Tuesday that while it is his dream for them to join the Abraham Accords with Israel, “you’ll do it in your own time.” Left unspoken was his recognition that Saudi Arabia will not normalize ties with an Israeli government, under Netanyahu, that refuses to set out even a theoretical pathway to Palestinian statehood.\nHe signed an unprecedentedly large arms deal with Riyadh, worth some $142 billion, doubtless to Jerusalem’s dismay (especially if Israel’s air supremacy is undermined). And he is reportedly discussing a deal regarding the Saudis’ desire for a civil nuclear program, which opposition leader Yair Lapid warned on Wednesday would trigger a Middle East nuclear race.\nHe is determined to seal a deal with Iran that, given the US zig-zagging on whether this will require the destruction of all of the regime’s nuclear facilities, has Jerusalem in panic mode.\nOver objections from Jerusalem, he’s lifted all sanctions on a Syrian leadership that Israel understandably regards as a terrorist regime unless or until proven otherwise, and asked President Ahmed al-Sharaa to normalize relations with Israel and join the Abraham Accords.\nAs I write, he’s just arrived in Qatar, the Hamas-funding, Hamas-hosting mediator that’s allegedly been paying some of Netanyahu’s aides to lobby on its behalf, and that Trump has insisted is “absolutely trying to help” resolve the hostage-war crisis.\nEvery one of these moves has vast implications for Israeli security, economy and the daily well-being of its people. Any Israeli government would have tried to influence and amend Trump’s rapid deal-making steps toward the Houthis, the Syrians, the Saudis and the Iranians. But Israel has been largely marginalized as Trump has advanced them.\nIt was being speculated in Jerusalem on Tuesday evening that Trump is angry with Netanyahu for having sought to push him toward a military strike on Iran, when he has been advocating diplomacy. It was also being suggested that Trump has concluded that Israel is simply no longer as central to American interests in the region.\nOpposition leader Lapid argued that Netanyahu had denied Israel a seat in Riyadh because of the far-right-driven policies of his coalition. “Netanyahu had two options,” said Lapid on Wednesday afternoon. “Either to do something in Khan Younis for the sixth time, or to be in Riyadh — to sit at the head of a table in Saudi Arabia and be part of agreements on a scale we’ve never known, bringing historic change to the Middle East. And he chose a military operation in Khan Younis” — targeting Hamas’s Gaza leader Mohammad Sinwar.\n“I’m in favor of eliminating the leaders of Hamas,” Lapid went on, referring to Tuesday’s IDF strike, “but for the national interest, we had to be in Saudi Arabia. And we’re not in Saudi Arabia because [Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners Bezalel] Smotrich and [Itamar] Ben Gvir won’t allow it. (The two party leaders insisted on March’s return to war in Gaza, after only the first of the three envisaged phases of the hostage-ceasefire deal finalized by Witkoff in January, and they are even more adamant than Netanyahu in their opposition to any notion of Palestinian statehood.) Said Lapid: “This is causing harm for generations and harm to our relations with the Americans.”\nFor now, with Trump and Netanyahu’s Israel, it appears to be less a case of “he’s not that into you,” and more a case of “I’m moving ahead, with or without you.” With this trip, Trump is soaringly elevating the Gulf states, and that, by definition, means Israel’s regional importance is reduced in the president’s considerations.\n“The transformation that has occurred under the leadership of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed [Bin Salman] has been truly extraordinary,” the president enthused of Saudi Arabia in his main address on Tuesday night, calling the crown prince the US’s strongest partner. “We have great partners in the world, but we have none stronger and nobody like the gentleman that’s right before me,” Trump said of Bin Salman, looking at the crown prince. “He’s your greatest representative… I like him too much… Great guy.”\nImplicit in Trump’s admiration for progress in the Gulf is a demotion of Israel as the go-to regional cutting-edge powerhouse, the prime innovator, the tech pioneer, the smart destination for investment. Right now, you can barely even fly here.\nIt is not clear how all this will affect Steve Witkoff’s efforts in Doha. Gilboa-Delal said Wednesday that the envoy told the families the US can’t decide for Israel on the terms it will accept to bring back hostages. But the US president has untold military, diplomatic and economic leverage he can bring to bear should he choose to.\nThe fact is that Trump is forging ahead with a whole slew of deals and alliances radically impacting Israel — and in so doing, he is already determining core aspects of Israel’s security and geopolitical future.\nHe said on the plane to Qatar that the US having good ties with the Gulf states “is very good for Israel.” Potentially, that is true, but only if the Israeli leadership proves capable of utilizing those ties. The longer Israel is not seated at the main table alongside the US president, metaphorically and literally, the narrower Israel’s room for maneuver.",

    "article": "US President Donald Trump told Gulf leaders on Wednesday that he urgently wants “to make a deal” with Iran to wind down its nuclear program, but that Tehran must end its support of proxy groups throughout the region as part of any potential agreement.\nIran “must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars, and permanently and verifiably cease pursuit of nuclear weapons,” Trump said in remarks at a meeting of leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council hosted by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh. “They cannot have a nuclear weapon.”\nThe US and Iran have engaged in four rounds of talks since early last month, focused on Iran’s nuclear program. Trump has repeatedly said he believes brokering a deal is possible, but that the window is closing.\nThe president’s strongly worded push on Iran to cease support of Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen comes after its proxy network suffered significant setbacks in the 19 months since Hamas launched its devastating October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, triggering war in the Gaza Strip.\nIn Iran, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called Trump’s remarks “deceitful” but did not directly address the US leader’s call on Iran to cease support of proxy groups.\n“What he stated about willing of the regional nations for a progressive, flourishing path, is the same path that people of Iran decided through their revolution, indeed, for having a fully independent, democratic, free, wealthy and advanced country,” Araghchi said.\nBoth Hezbollah and the Houthis attacked Israel with rockets and drones in support of Gaza shortly after the October 7 onslaught. The fighting with Hezbollah escalated into open war in September, which ended with a ceasefire last November after Israel decimated the terror group’s leadership and resources.\nThe Houthis are still firing at Israel and though most missiles and drones have been thwarted by air defense systems — including a missile on Wednesday morning — some have slipped through, killing a person in Tel Aviv and causing damage on other occasions. Last week, a missile hit within the grounds of Ben Gurion Airport, prompting international carriers to halt flights to Israel. Retaliatory Israeli airstrikes have destroyed significant Houthi-controlled infrastructure in Yemen.\nTrump in March ordered the US to carry out intensive strikes on the Houthis, citing the group’s attacks on shipping in the Red Sea as part of its campaign against Israel, disrupting a vital global sea route. Earlier this month, he announced a ceasefire agreement had been reached under which the Houthis agreed to no longer attack US Navy or American ships in the Red Sea, though they said they would continue attacking Israel.\nIn Riyadh, Trump also said that he believed the moment was ripe “for a [Lebanese] future free from the grip of Hezbollah terrorists.” The terror group is severely weakened after its war with Israel, in which much of its top leadership was killed, and after losing a key ally with the fall of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, whose country had served as a conduit for Iran to send arms.",

    "subheading": "Freed hostage’s aunt says he received more food following US election, while a report claims dual citizen was also moved to a nicer tunnel alongside senior Hamas officials",
    "date": "Updated 11:49 PM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "Freed hostage Edan Alexander’s conditions in captivity improved following the inauguration of US President Donald Trump in January, according to a family member.\nAlexander’s aunt, Sharon Senyor, told the Ynet news site on Wednesday that “he said that since Trump took power his conditions improved. From the moment they started to talk about him, they gave him more food so that he would gain weight.”\nYnet also reported, citing conversations Alexander had with others since his release on Monday, that following Trump’s inauguration, the freed hostage was moved to a “VIP tunnel” with senior Hamas officials in order to both serve as a human shield and provide him with further protection due to his American citizenship.\nThis echoes comments Alexander reportedly made during his phone conversation with Trump on Tuesday. According to Channel 12 news, Alexander, when asked by the US president how Hamas had treated him, answered: “Since you got elected, my conditions improved dramatically. There are tons of cameras and people around me right now — I can’t share much at the moment. We’ll talk in private.”\nAlthough reports had circulated that Alexander might fly to Doha on Wednesday to meet with Trump, his family said following his release that he required further medical treatment before leaving the country, and expects to meet the US president in Washington in the future.\nAlexander, 21, the last living hostage with American citizenship, was freed from Gaza on Monday, after 584 days in captivity, following indirect talks between the US and Hamas. The negotiations sidelined Israeli officials, who were updated only after the deal was struck.\nA dual citizen who grew up in New Jersey, Alexander was serving in the IDF’s Golani Brigade at the time of his abduction. Hamas kidnapped him from his base near the Gaza border community of Nirim, known as the White House post, during its October 7 onslaught.\nHe is the first male IDF soldier to be freed by Hamas since the start of the war. The other hostages with US citizenship still remaining in the Strip have all been declared dead by Israeli officials — soldiers Itay Chen and Omer Neutra and married couple Judith Weinstein and Gadi Haggai.\nTrump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, pressed heavily on Hamas and Israel to agree to a January ceasefire that went into effect even before Trump took office. Pressure and threats from Trump are considered to have played a significant role in ultimately bringing the deal to fruition after more than a year of stalled talks.\nDuring that deal, Hamas freed 30 hostages, including five Thai nationals, and returned the bodies of eight slain Israeli captives. Two of those freed, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Keith Siegel, also had US citizenship, and Siegel met with Trump in the White House in March.\nIn March, Hamas offered to free only Alexander and the bodies of the other hostages with US citizenship, a move rejected by Israel and later also rejected by Witkoff.\nAlexander told soldiers who received him in the Strip that Hamas subjected him to harsh torture for weeks on end and kept him in a cage over a long period of time with his hands and feet bound, the Kan public broadcaster reported.\nIn remarks to reporters on Tuesday evening, his parents, Yael and Adi, spoke of Edan’s suffering during more than 19 months of captivity.\nYael said her son suffered from a lack of water, food and other aid. He also described the terror he experienced when the IDF would strike Gaza, destroying buildings.\n“The strikes and bombs made him think that every moment was about to be his last one,” she said. “Edan, my hero, you returned from the horror. But other hostages are still living through that threat, they are still living in that hell. My heart has returned to beating, but they still need to return home.”\nAccording to the Channel 12 news network, Alexander was severely beaten during the early period of his captivity, and he returned to Israel with flea bites and bruises all over his body.\nIsrael believes that 58 hostages are still being held by terror groups in Gaza, including 35 confirmed dead by Israeli authorities and another three about whom Israel has expressed severe concern. The 35 bodies include that of an IDF soldier who was killed in 2014.",

    "subheading": "With little evidence the top commander had the same sway his brother Yahya did in Hamas’s decision making, it’s doubtful his death will have much impact on hostage-ceasefire talks",
    "date": "Updated 06:19 PM GMT+5:30, May 14, 2025",
    "article": "On Tuesday afternoon, Israeli forces launched a wave of airstrikes on underground infrastructure near the European Hospital in Khan Younis, sending plumes of gray smoke into the sky above southern Gaza.\nIsraeli security officials say the massive bombardment was aimed at Muhammad Sinwar, thought to be the de facto leader of the Hamas terror group in Gaza.\nSinwar assumed leadership of Hamas’s military wing following the July assassination of its previous leader Mohammed Deif, and later emerged as the group’s top commander in the Strip after his older brother Yahya Sinwar, who had been Hamas’s leader and orchestrated Hamas’s October 7, 2023 invasion and massacre in southern Israel, was killed by Israeli forces in late October.\nAccording to Hamas-run Gaza health authorities, at least 16 people were killed and over 70 were wounded in the Tuesday strikes as air force jets dropped dozens of bombs around the hospital. As of Wednesday afternoon, it was uncertain if Sinwar was among them.\nIsraeli intelligence believes Sinwar was inside the targeted tunnels at the time of the attack.\nAccording to security sources, if he was inside, he was likely killed due to the force of the strike, but confirmation is still pending.\nEven if he was killed, though, it remains unclear how much of an impact his assassination would have on the terror group, whose senior leadership largely lives outside the Gaza Strip.\nIsraeli officials have described Sinwar as obstinate with regard to negotiations with Hamas for the release of hostages, and an obstacle to reaching a ceasefire deal. But unlike his brother, who had wielded considerable influence over the direction of talks and the group’s strategic planning, it seems Muhammad Sinwar had only a limited role in either.\nThe younger Sinwar’s death might be felt keenly inside Hamas’s armed wing, where it would deepen a leadership vacuum, with most of the group’s top figures living abroad since the war began with the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack, in which thousands of terrorists killed some 1,200 people and abducted 251.\nThere are two potential successors who can replace him in managing Hamas’s military wing and attempting to rebuild it during the ongoing war.\nThe first is Izz ad-Din Haddad, commander of Hamas’s Gaza City Brigade, who is a longtime fixture within the senior echelons of Hamas’s armed wing. During the war, Haddad was promoted to oversee the entire Gaza Strip.\nHaddad rarely appears in public, but in May 2022 was seen in a video threatening Israel. In January, he went on Al-Jazeera and disclosed his role in planning the October 7 massacre. His face was blurred for the interview.\nAnother candidate is Mohammad Shabana, commander of the Rafah Brigade, who has risen through the ranks over the years. He reportedly survived an Israeli airstrike in May 2024 targeting a tunnel in Rafah. In March 2025, his wife and five children were killed in an Israeli strike.\nLike Haddad, Shabana is relatively unknown in Gaza and has not appeared in public during the war.\nBoth are veteran Hamas fighters who could help the organization continue its operations against Israel and even recover some strength.\nBut neither would likely have significant influence over Hamas’s strategic decision-making process, similar to the limited role played by Muhammad Sinwar.\nWhile Yahya Sinwar was a central Hamas figure with sway over ceasefire negotiations and final say over hostage deals, there is little evidence that his little brother has held a comparable position.\nYahya Sinwar was elected by Hamas members as the group’s Gaza leader in 2017 and officially appointed by the senior members of Hamas as the movement’s overall chief in August 2024. In contrast, Muhammad Sinwar has never been part of the political bureau.\nDespite operating while in hiding inside Gaza, unlike the rest of the group’s Qatar-based senior leadership, Yahya Sinwar was reportedly given final say in indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel that largely took place in Cairo.\nIsraeli sources indicated that the need to consult with Sinwar for Hamas’s answer in talks led to significant delays, with an elaborate system of mediators used to convey messages back and forth, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n“We’ll have to wait for Yahya Sinwar’s reply from the tunnels on every comma and detail of the negotiation,” one Israeli defense source was quoted complaining in March 2024, according to Channel 12 news.\nNone of this occurred once Muhammad Sinwar took over. Recent negotiations have been conducted with Hamas’s political leadership outside Gaza, and there have been no reports of delays due to a need to wait for Mohammad Sinwar’s input. Even the indirect channel between Hamas and the United States that led to the release of hostage soldier Edan Alexander on Monday was conducted via senior Hamas officials in Qatar.\nThough Muhammad Sinwar was considered Hamas’s de facto chief, officially the group is run by a five-member leadership council.\nAll members are senior figures from the political wing with no direct involvement in military operations. All reside outside Gaza — some have been abroad for years, while others left the Strip shortly before the war began.\nThe council includes Hamas spokesman Khalil al-Hayya, who is its top man for Gaza, though he likely wields little sway inside the Strip from his Gulf perch.\nThe remaining council members are Khaled Mashaal, Hamas leader abroad; Zaher Jabarin, head of Hamas in the West Bank; Mohammad Darwish, head of Hamas’s Shura Council, who is responsible for long-term strategic decisions; and Nizar Awadallah, a member of Hamas’s political bureau.\nOperating from deep underground in Gaza, in limited contact with the group’s senior leadership and holding little experience outside of military affairs, it’s tough to see how Muhammad Sinwar could have been a decisive voice on the ceasefire issue.\nWhile Hamas’s armed wing has leverage in any hostage deal due to its direct custody of those it abducted from Israel on October 7, its influence over broader strategic decisions is limited.\nShould Sinwar’s death be confirmed, it will almost certainly have no impact on the group’s positions or demands in hostage and ceasefire negotiations, which will continue to be determined by the leadership outside of Gaza. The deepest impact, therefore, might simply be that the sides will no longer have him to blame for their inability to make progress on freeing the hostages and ending the war.",
